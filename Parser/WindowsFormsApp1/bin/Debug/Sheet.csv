Challenges/VIP_RivalBoss_Orb_Reward_Message_1	Agatha Sphere from The Orb Foundation was heard cackling maniacally as she left the hospital earlier. This cannot be a good thing. What did she do during her visit?!		
Challenges/VIP_RivalBoss_Orb_Reward_Message_2	A leaked memo from The Orb Foundation reports that Agatha Sphere managed to find some new recruits during her hospital tour earlier, adding that she thought the hospital was "a bit rubbish". Not ideal, to be honest.		
Challenges/VIP_RivalBoss_Orb_Reward_Message_3	Reports from The Orb Foundation suggest that Agatha Sphere bumped into a few "weak minded simpletons" during her hospital tour, but otherwise has "strong feelings of neutrality" towards us. Hmmm.		
Challenges/VIP_RivalBoss_Orb_Reward_Message_4	According to an Orb Foundation senior doctor, or 'supreme healer' as they like to be known, Agatha Sphere returned from her visit looking quite frustrated. Maybe we're doing better than she expected?		
Challenges/VIP_RivalBoss_Orb_Reward_Message_5	The Orb Foundation just released a new promotional video containing a thinly veiled attack on our hospital in the form of some very bizarre and slightly disturbing imagery. Agatha Sphere must have felt threatened by her visit.		
Challenges/VIP_RivalBoss_Orb_V1_Intro_Message	Rival executive, and CEO of The Orb Foundation, Agatha Sphere will be visiting the hospital, soon. It's not often she makes appearances, so we should feel honoured, I suppose…\nWe should expect her to bother our patients, and disrupt the hospital.

Collaborative/Letter/Intro_Letter	Your organisation shows great promise, and, as a result, has been chosen to take part in the Bungle Superbug Initiative. Congratulations.\n\nThe Superbug Initiative was founded with the intention of connecting the finest minds in the County in order to tackle our most pressing medical concerns. Since then, Superbug has transformed into the premier interface for all forms of research and technology.\n\nYou have been given access to the Superbug Network, when you're ready, dive headfirst into the exciting world of collaborative research.		
Collaborative/MetamapLetter_Animals	On my most recent trip to a hospital, I found myself thinking: "this place needs more animals". But which animals would be appropriate for a medical facility as well as good company for our patients and staff? Yaks? Emus? Platypuses? I quickly realised that I wasn't fit to make that decision alone.\n\nI'd like to investigate which creatures would be most suitable for this task. Above all else, they should improve the overall "Alive : Dead" ratio in any given hospital.\n\nThe Superbug Initiative has launched a Global Project. Check the Superbug Network to contribute to the project and collect rewards.		
Collaborative/MetamapLetter_ArtStatues	Two Point County's least unknown artist, Zara Fitzpocket, is looking to break out of a creative rut by "collaborating with the Superbug Network". We were confused at first too, don't worry, but it seems like she just wants us to complete some medical tasks to inform and inspire a series of work she's calling "Meditations on Mortality".\n\nThe Superbug Initiative has launched a Global Project. Check the Superbug Network to contribute to the project and collect rewards.		
Collaborative/MetamapLetter_FruitLoot	Is it just me, or do our hospitals just not look summery enough this time of year?\n\nAfter a lot of scientific data analysis, I randomly decided that they'd look better if they were a bit "fruitier". I'm not sure what that means, practically, but that's why we have you lot. Get to it.\n\nThe Superbug Initiative has launched a Global Project. Check the Superbug Network to contribute to the project and collect rewards.		
Collaborative/MetamapLetter_Jasmine	Jasmine Odyssey wants to combine two of her favourite things: nice smells and clean hands, with, what she's calling her "Nice Smelling Sanitiser". She's asked the Superbug Initiative to gather a huge amount of data so that her aromatic technicians can design the finest, most fragrant steriliser Two Point County has ever seen.\n\nThe Superbug Initiative has launched a Global Project. Check the Superbug Network to contribute to the project and collect rewards.		
Collaborative/MetamapLetter_MedSet	The Superbug Initiative is excited to announce, and open, its first Global Project.\n\nBungle have created a new thingamajig: the Quadra-Hyper Neuro-Perma Batho-Omni Gyro-Nut, or Gyro-Nut for short. We've been waiting for the right moment to unite everyone in the Superbug Network on a single project, and, with the recent development of this cutting-edge machine component, now is the perfect time!\n\nOur scientists believe that there are countless possible applications for the Gyro-Nut, and they're calling for the entire Superbug Network to explore different avenues of research to help design some new medical technology.		
Collaborative/MetamapLetter_Signature	Thank you,\nSophie Nova\nCEO, Bungle Technologies		
Collaborative/MetamapLetter_Snacks	I come to you, friends, in the hope of improving work environments throughout the County. My plan is based upon two key principles...\n\nOne, I hate getting hungry at work. Two, I love eating food from a platter. \n\nThe Superbug Initiative has launched a Global Project.

Collaborative/ProjectDescription_1	Bungle thinks that unwanted, animated hair should be a thing of the past. Collect data on that shaggy floor-worm, the pesky Monobeast! - and help develop a more modern, painless disposal method.\n\nThis project can be completed alone, but progress may be faster with contributions from another healthcare organisation.		
Collaborative/ProjectDescription_2	Health Inspector Henry Jobsworth has penned an open letter in the Two Point Squabbler: "I believe that we may be misdiagnosing the condition known as "Love". Long believed to originate organically and incorporeally, it may, in fact, be an illness. If this proves to be the case, all previous health inspections would be null and void, and all healthcare would be required to stop, immediately, to allow for new inspections."\n\nIt's not as urgent as Henry makes it sound, as fortunately/unfortunately no one really listens to Mr Jobsworth at the ministry, but it's an interesting line of inquiry and it would really calm him down if we reached a conclusion on the matter. You'll need at least one other organisation to conduct this research.		
Collaborative/ProjectDescription_3	The fine people at Bungle believe that Two Point County is leaving one of its largest resources untapped: the deceased population. They began toying with ways of putting the perished to work, but all plans were shelved. Help resurrect their plans, and the usefulness of our ancestors, to make the most of your organisation's less fortunate former patients.\n\nIt looks like this amount of work would be better suited for a few organisations.		
Collaborative/ProjectDescription_4	The big cheeses at Cheesy Gubbins want to run the most comprehensive study in the history of  cheese "to understand the sacred balance between man and cheese, for the betterment of all Two Point County, and to dictate the future of the gubbin".\n\nThey require substantial research into the constitution of the Pointian, as well as how it responds to, and how its been shaped by, cheese. Who'd have thought there was so much to know about cheese?... The people at Cheesy Gubbins, I guess.		
Collaborative/ProjectDescription_5	The story goes that one night, late at Bungle HQ, Sophie Nova had a sequence of words flow through her and onto her Bureaucats notepad: "machines what think if could". She was convinced that there was a significant idea in there somewhere, but couldn't decipher her own moment of inspiration. Several years and thousands of notepads later, the sequence would unscramble itself before her eyes: "what if machines could think"...\n\nIt's been Sophie's pet project ever since, but it's been nothing more than a pipedream, until now. A huge amount of varied data needs to be gathered in order to create artificial intelligence capable of working in healthcare.

Collaborative/ProjectVictoryMessage_3	The Superbug Initiative are happy to announce that another project has been completed.\n\nCongratulations on a successful contribution to the development of Two Point County.\n\nWe've improved the functionality of the deceased.

Collaborative/ProjectVictoryMessage_4	The Superbug Initiative are happy to announce that another project has been completed.\n\nCongratulations on a successful contribution to the development of Two Point County.\n\nWe now know more about cheese than any civilised society has ever known about cheese. Cheesy Gubbins has slightly modified their 500 year plan to reflect the research. They're so please that they've sent you all a commemorative plinth.		
Collaborative/ProjectVictoryMessage_5	The Superbug Initiative are happy to announce that another project has been completed.\n\nCongratulations on a successful contribution to the development of Two Point County.\n\nOur new AI has already started telling jokes and asking questions.

The whole community will need to work together to complete this project. A certain number of organisations will need to complete each Research Node in order to advance down the research tree and find the Victory Nodes for this project. Each organisation can only have one Research Node active at a time, so choose wisely. If you're lucky, the community might have already completed some Victory Nodes, so be sure to collect the rewards.

DJ/Game Intro/Line_1	Welcome to another beautiful day in Two Point County. If you find yourself in Lower Bullocks this morning, don't forget it's 'Hug-a-Hog' day down at Merrydung Farm-		
DJ/Game Intro/Line_2	‐which is why the human species is doomed. Meanwhile, fresh snow has fallen on the Pointy Mountains. Not so great news for researchers at the medical campus, whose lab equipment has frozen again‐		
DJ/Game Intro/Line_3	‐they might count themselves lucky they're not employed at the Melt Downs, where a small industrial incident has taken local temperatures to record highs‐		
DJ/Game Intro/Line_4	‐Sweaty Palms recorded its fifth earthquake of the year, would you believe it? Apparently, the shocks were felt all the way in Grockle Bay Zoo, but it's said the animals are doing just fine‐		
DJ/Game Intro/Line_5	‐the Croquembouche stock market showed corporate giants Jumbo still leading the way, despite stiff competition from its rivals. Well, their company motto is "crush all opposition", after all‐		
DJ/Game Intro/Line_6	‐so we turn our attention to Hogsport, where we have just learned that our esteemed Health and Safety inspector, Henry Jobsworth, has approved the opening of a new hospital. We shall follow its progress with interest… and do to remember to listen to Two Point Radio for all the latest County news.

Oh, and don’t forget the pillow mints.\n\nContinue down the rabbit-hole of obscurity for more rewards, or return to civilization and get back to work.		
Levels/DLC_1/R6_InjuriesHospital_Letter_Star_3	Congratulations. Your hospital has been awarded a 3 Star rating by the Two Point Health Ministry.\n\nI find it very curious that you’ve decided to provide a third-rate hotel with a first-rate hospital. Perhaps you were hoping that the hotel might accrue quality through sheer proximity. Perhaps you just like developing high-quality hospitals. You know, the more that I think about it, the more that I think that, perhaps, I don’t care.

Levels/DLC_1/R6_InjuriesHospital_Welcome_Text	Welcome to Underlook. This Hotel & Resort suffers from misfortune and bad management, resulting in accidents, outbreaks of disease and unhappy guests. The owner is sick of negative reviews and diminishing profits, so they've set up a ‘medical emergency budget’ to salvage the hotel’s reputation and avoid any more lawsuits. You’ve been invited to run the resort’s brand-new medical facility.\n\nInstead of being paid for processing patients, you’ll be given money for completing targets set by the hotel, and receive a monthly performance bonus based on how successfully you've been treating guests. For the first three months, all of your running costs will be covered by your monthly bonus. As you’re a part of the hotel, you’ll have to contend with all of the bad press it receives: it might be worth investing in some marketing…

You’ve been invited to rejuvenate the Swelbard Research Institute by setting up a research hospital. As well as treating the area’s ills, you’ll need to complete some of the Institute’s outstanding research.\n\nSwelbard is an isolated place, so it may be difficult to find staff willing to come here.

I’ve got one more project lined up for you...\n\nI’ve been contacted by the Roquefort family, one of the oldest families in the County, and they’ve offered to let you use one of their spare castles. It seems that they’re still looking for some positive publicity in their community after centuries of feudalism, squalor and meanly-rationed wheat.\n\nYou’ll be providing healthcare for the mountain community that lives around the castle.

Currently, we’re not exactly what you would term ‘official’. We’ll need to clean the place up a bit before the island’s medical authorities are willing to recognise this as a hospital and give us a medical license.\n\nWiggy’s using the hospital to make good on all those times he’s offered someone a job without thinking it through; for some reason he thought it’d be a good idea for them to work as our janitorial staff. We won’t have access to a pool of highly trained medical janitors. Instead, we’ll be able to hire other, random, totally inexperienced people. We’ll need to get training, or maybe just hire loads of them, as Pebberley receives some of the most erratic and unique weather in the County.

Much more suitable than those pointy Pointy mountains they have in the north. The ancient people certainly thought so, that’s why they did lots of building here back in the ancient times, with their ancient tools.\n\nThe transport out here is a nightmare, as you can imagine, and tourists that make it this far tend to have gotten sick on their travels, so big groups (we’re calling them ‘waves’) of sickly sightseers will be turning up all at once. Whilst you’re treating them, Wiggy’s crew will be excavating the ruins.

Levels/DLC_4/R9_EcoCityHospital_PostTutorial_Title	Green Energy		
Levels/DLC_4/R9_EcoCityHospital_Welcome_Text	Welcome to Windsock, the County’s first eco-city and its most expensive thing to be named after, and founded by, the same person. The city has taken over the news, provoking questions like: “How does this work?”, “Why haven’t we done it before?” and “Who paid for this?”. Say what you like about Tabitha, she really wants to get re-elected.\n\nWindsock City doesn’t rely on the usual means of power. Instead, you’ll need to build green energy machines to stay switched-on and self-sufficient. Each of your green energy machines, whether it’s a wind turbine, solar panel or hydro dam, will increase the power capacity of the hospital. The power that you generate can be used to open rooms in your hospital, or allocated to the Patient Flow and Staff Applicants systems, to influence transport in and out of the city.

Levels/DLC_4/R9_HippyCommuneHospital_Welcome_Text	Welcome to the Wanderoff County Park, where Holistix have been farming rare, natural ingredients for years. Once they heard that the Mayor was planning to trial her green initiative in the area, they decided to open a nature commune, and take advantage of the foot traffic. It's our job to care for the people attached to those feet. Our funding from Holistix will depend on how well we're scoring on their new scale... \n\nYes, the (less than) fine people at Holistix have developed something called a "Wellness Index", which uses a number of different criteria to measure the overall wellbeing of a community. They believe that they've found a correlation between high scores on the Wellness Index and a willingness to purchase their organic tat. We won't receive much for diagnosing and treating patients, so if we want to make money we'll need to score well on the Wellness Index by focusing on its six criteria: staff and patient happiness; attractiveness; hygiene; reputation; and cure rate.

I couldn’t have done it without you, so please make sure you feel well and truly responsible.\n\nSadly, the time has come to put an end to our green project. Sometimes we must have the courage to take one step forward, and two steps back. The tide of public opinion has turned, and so too must my focus, to the next hot topic, if I’m to be re-elected again. That’s right, I will not rest until the latest issue on everyone’s mind has been resolved: the education of our County’s dogs.		
Levels/DLC_4/R9_Mayor_Letter_Pre_Amish	The success of the community in Wanderoff has kicked things off perfectly for the Department of Green Things. It’s shown the potential of the County when people are brought together with a common goal in mind: voting for me.\n\nNext on the campaign trail, you’ll be heading to Old Newpoint. There are lots of new, enthusiastic residents getting involved in traditional, green activities like gardening and… others. I’m told that they like the history of the place so much, that they’re knocking down old buildings and replacing them with buildings that look even older. It’s great to see people getting into the spirit of my campaign.		
Levels/DLC_4/R9_Mayor_Letter_Pre_EcoCity	So sorry that I wasn’t able to make it - again - but as long as you’re there I know that Team Windsock is well represented. That being said… Our stay in Old Newpoint has been another rousing success for the Department of Green Things. Now, to steal the deal with the final stop on the campaign trail. You’re going to like this. It’s time to cut the ribbon on our County’s first eco-city, my gift to the people of this county: Windsock City!\n\nWell, if the people won’t build you a city, use their money to build one yourself. Only joking, of course. I mean, that is what I’ve done, but I don’t mean it like that, you know? People can’t take a joke… or the truth. People hate the truth. What am I saying. Bla-bla-bla. Anyway, good luck!

Please, support the initiative by taking care of our green-minded, recently-pro-windsock, community. I need them in this time of need, uncertainty and poor voter polling, because, frankly, the dead can’t vote.

Your hospital has been awarded a 3 Star rating by the Two Point Health Ministry.\n\nWho would have thought, when you took over this hospital, that we were in store for such archetypal rags-to-riches tale. Now that I’ve put it in those terms, I find it quite sickening.		
Levels/R5_FailingHospital_Name	Rotting Hill		
Levels/R5_FailingHospital_Welcome_Text	Rotting Hill Hospital has been on its last legs for a while, thanks in part to the ruthless business practices of Jumbo Healthcare. It's out of cash, reputation is poor, and it smells faintly of cabbage. Mayor Windsock and the Health Ministry have made the tough decision to transfer ownership from the Two Point Health Service over to our organisation.\\n\\nWe'll need a loan if we want to turn this place around!

Levels/R5_FinalHospital_Description	Build a hospital in the busiest part of the city centre. Prepare for an onslaught. Good luck!		
Levels/R5_FinalHospital_Letter_Star_1	Congratulations. Your hospital has been awarded a 1 Star rating by the Two Point Health Ministry.\n\nYour organisation has become the gold standard for healthcare in Two Point County. You’ve risen above all competition, leaving their long-held hopes and dreams lying, soiled, in a shabby tatters, on the ground. A soothing thought, is it not?\n\nContinue aiding the County’s most hectic area to cement your legacy.		
Levels/R5_FinalHospital_Letter_Star_2	Congratulations. Your hospital has been awarded a 2 Star rating by the Two Point Health Ministry.\n\nI’m sure we’re in agreeance that my sterling leadership is to thank for you overcoming some of your more questionable qualities. But where exactly is my acclaim, my long-overdue notoriety, my fancy letter?\nI implore you to reflect on this injustice in place of any pencilled-in jubilatory shenanigans.\n\nContinue aiding the County’s most hectic area to cement your legacy.		
Levels/R5_FinalHospital_Letter_Star_3	Congratulations. Your hospital has been awarded a 3 Star rating by the Two Point Health Ministry.\n\nThe news media have begun to deliberate concernedly about “overpopulation”, surely there is no greater compliment to a hospital administrator.\n\nYour name shall reverberate through the halls of the Ministry for generations, interrupting our all-too-brief silences and reminding us of the County’s true potential. Maybe at some point I’ll commit it to memory…

Levels/R5_FinalHospital_Welcome_Text	Welcome to the heart of the city. This is it, our toughest challenge yet. Thousands of people flood through Croquembouche every day. At least half of them are sick, in my opinion. The tower of Jumbo Mega Corporation looms in the distance. Jumbo Healthcare have dominated for too long. If we can build a successful hospital here, we will cement our position as one of the top organisations in the county.

Levels/R5_HighTechHospital_Letter_Star_2	Congratulations. Your hospital has been awarded a 2 Star rating by the Two Point Health Ministry.\n\nAlthough I’m delighted to hear that you’re propelling our County’s healthcare into the future, as it were, I ask that you do be wary of your mechanical associates, lest we unwittingly bring about the end of times. Anyway, smashing job.\n\nContinue modernising the County for more rewards, or go elsewhere and expand your organisation.		
Levels/R5_HighTechHospital_Letter_Star_3	Congratulations. Your hospital has been awarded a 3 Star rating by the Two Point Health Ministry.\n\nI’m told that the future depends upon increased automation, and, whilst I might contend the point behind closed doors, I’m well aware that it’s in my best political interest to support this ill-conceived cause publically. I refuse to seem out of touch, you see, besides… no one likes a moth in the marmalade.

Levels/R5_HighTechHospital_Welcome_Text	Welcome to Pelican Wharf. This high-tech hub is bustling with activity, and plagued by some tricky ailments.

Levels/Remix/Intro_Letter	I would like to invite you to use R.E.M.I. X, or Rendered Environments of Medical Intrigue... X, a software that simulates hospital management (if you can imagine such a thing). It'll be used to train the County's administrators of the future in a safe setting where people aren't actually dying, but it's not ready just yet. The software needs to analyse existing hospitals to model its hypothetical healthcare scenarios. Those scenarios will need testing, too, preferably by someone who knows what they're doing.\n\nIf it wasn't clear, please test out the software. That'd be swell... Thanks!
