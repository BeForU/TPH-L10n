Popstar Jasmine Odyssey is arriving at the hospital.
We've been contacted by the agent of a local celebrity who is interested in visiting the hospital. Her name is Jasmine "Jazz" Odyssey. She's a pop star or something like that. God knows. Apparently the kids view her as some kind of musical deity. Could give us some good publicity. Shall we accept the visit?
Celebrity Visit
Unfortunately it looks like Jasmine Odyssey wasn't a big fan of the hospital. She's just released her new song, "Hospital Atrocity Exhibition". It's got one of those explicit lyrics stickers on the front. This is not a good sign.
Publicity Update
It appears that our hospital didn't make much of an impression on Jasmine Odyssey. She hasn't posted anything on ChatFace, nothing on Growler either. In her live stream on Fumble she's currently staring at a biscuit. I guess we need to try harder next time.
Publicity Update
Jasmine Odyssey has just posted a photo of the hospital on Bungle (I don't know what that is, but apparently the youngsters love it). It's a selfie taken outside the main entrance. She's doing one of those pouty faces and holding a biscuit. I guess that's a good sign. The photo has received 300 Bear Love, whatever that means. She must have enjoyed her visit. Good work everyone.
Publicity Update
Good news. Jasmine Odyssey has just released a new song, "Ultimate Rainbow Hospital Unicorn Jazz Biscuits". We think this is a good sign, but honestly the lyrics are gibberish to me. She's kindly offered to donate some money to the hospital too!

Lord Foxbridge sent a memo to offer his commiserations, after we failed to achieve our targets:\n\n"You swines! You're making me look like an oaf. No extra funding for you, I'm afraid. Having said that, the chaps down at Pelican Wharf are loving this. Shares in Jumbo Healthcare just skyrocketed. Boff!"
Lord Foxbridge sent a memo to offer his commiserations, after we failed to achieve our targets:\n\n"Oh shoot! No extra funding for Duckworth Hospital this month. Might splash out on some of those new ruby-lined curtains for the office though. Come on chaps, at least make it look like you're trying."
Lord Foxbridge sent a memo to congratulate us on achieving our targets:\n\n"Jolly good! I'm sure you'll agree we did an excellent job there. I really am steering this ship through choppy waters. Captain Foxbridge has a nice ring to it. Right, I suppose I can crack open the public coffers and allow you a small amount of additional funding. Maybe I'll cut down on the number of helicopter trips I make this month."
Lord Foxbridge sent a memo to congratulate us on achieving our targets:\n\n"Tally ho! Another job well done. The papers love it. And by it I mean me. Champagne all round. Well, here at least. I'll be transferring over some additional funds, but don't you get any ideas. That's public money you scallywags!"

"I used to be terrified of ghosts. But since my autopsychic training, I find them strangely alluring. Maybe we should capture a few?"

"I'm feeling very itchy. More so than usual. That and I keep getting the sniffles. Can we improve hygiene levels around here?"

"It would be great to work in a really spacious environment with lots of luxury furnishing. Something really prestigious. What do you think?"
"I'd love to have a really big, plush staff room to relax in on my break. How about it, boss?"
"I've been experiencing a lot of rage recently. I'm sure I heard someone sobbing in the toilets too. Don't forget, a happy team is a productive team."
"If there's one thing I learned from my training masterclass, it's that we should train people. Wisdom like that is precious."
"Some of the more junior staff are a bit, well, rubbish. Maybe we should run a few more training courses?"
"Upgrading our machines could really help us cure more patients, and diagnose people faster. As a mechanics enthusiast, I highly recommend it!"

Superbug Network\nCollaborative Projects
Consecutive Cures
Albert Crank
Did you know that thinking about the size of this project is making my head hurt? I need to lie down.
First
Oh, and I almost forgot… This is the Superbug group chat. The chat can be used to communicate with fellow collaborators, to coordinate research strategies or interact in an affable manner, as I'm doing now. Good day.
Greetings! To begin, click on a research node to view its criteria and select "Start", then head to one of your hospitals. Advance down the Research Tree to find and complete its Victory Nodes, in order to finish the project.
Not all avenues of research are going to be fruitful… The more people you have working on a project, the faster you can eliminate any dead ends.
Did you know (I love doing that) that the Project Leader can invite friends to join a project and help with the workload? Look out for Research Nodes that require data from more than one organisation.
Sophie Nova
The potential applications of this technology are countless, and far too multitudinous to name. Still, I'm so excited that I'm going to start making a list to celebrate!
…
An added bonus of you taking up this project is that I've been sent a year's supply of Cheesy Gubbins. And people say there aren't any perks to being a CEO! Thanks everyone.
I was meant to look into this ages ago, but Monobeasts make my skin crawl!
I tried experimenting with ghosts before. I should have realised that a haunted alarm clock was going to be a terrifying way to wake up… There has to be a better idea! Cue, you guys.
You'll need a partner to research loooooooooove
No, but seriously you'll need more than one person for this one.

Meditations on Mortality
The Superbug Initiative is happy to announce that the Fruit Loot Global Project has been completed.\n\nOur hospitals should look a lot more summery now, with all that fruit everywhere. Will that make them better hospitals? That's not for me to say. Do they look good, though? Yes, yes they do.\n\nWell done, everyone. Enjoy the fruit of your labour.
Help the Superbug Initiative introduce some fruity flavour to the County's hospitals.

Your organisation shows great promise, and, as a result, has been chosen to take part in the Bungle Superbug Initiative. Congratulations.\n\nThe Superbug Initiative was founded with the intention of connecting the finest minds in the County in order to tackle our most pressing medical concerns. Since then, Superbug has transformed into the premier interface for all forms of research and technology.\n\nYou have been given access to the Superbug Network, when you're ready, dive headfirst into the exciting world of collaborative research.
On my most recent trip to a hospital, I found myself thinking: "this place needs more animals". But which animals would be appropriate for a medical facility as well as good company for our patients and staff? Yaks? Emus? Platypuses? I quickly realised that I wasn't fit to make that decision alone.\n\nI'd like to investigate which creatures would be most suitable for this task. Above all else, they should improve the overall "Alive : Dead" ratio in any given hospital.\n\nThe Superbug Initiative has launched a Global Project. Check the Superbug Network to contribute to the project and collect rewards.
Two Point County's least unknown artist, Zara Fitzpocket, is looking to break out of a creative rut by "collaborating with the Superbug Network". We were confused at first too, don't worry, but it seems like she just wants us to complete some medical tasks to inform and inspire a series of work she's calling "Meditations on Mortality".\n\nThe Superbug Initiative has launched a Global Project. Check the Superbug Network to contribute to the project and collect rewards.
Is it just me, or do our hospitals just not look summery enough this time of year?\n\nAfter a lot of scientific data analysis, I randomly decided that they'd look better if they were a bit "fruitier". I'm not sure what that means, practically, but that's why we have you lot. Get to it.\n\nThe Superbug Initiative has launched a Global Project. Check the Superbug Network to contribute to the project and collect rewards.
Jasmine Odyssey wants to combine two of her favourite things: nice smells and clean hands, with, what she's calling her "Nice Smelling Sanitiser". She's asked the Superbug Initiative to gather a huge amount of data so that her aromatic technicians can design the finest, most fragrant steriliser Two Point County has ever seen.\n\nThe Superbug Initiative has launched a Global Project. Check the Superbug Network to contribute to the project and collect rewards.
The Superbug Initiative is excited to announce, and open, its first Global Project.\n\nBungle have created a new thingamajig: the Quadra-Hyper Neuro-Perma Batho-Omni Gyro-Nut, or Gyro-Nut for short. We've been waiting for the right moment to unite everyone in the Superbug Network on a single project, and, with the recent development of this cutting-edge machine component, now is the perfect time!\n\nOur scientists believe that there are countless possible applications for the Gyro-Nut, and they're calling for the entire Superbug Network to explore different avenues of research to help design some new medical technology.
Thank you,\nSophie Nova\nCEO, Bungle Technologies
I come to you, friends, in the hope of improving work environments throughout the County. My plan is based upon two key principles...\n\nOne, I hate getting hungry at work. Two, I love eating food from a platter. \n\nThe Superbug Initiative has launched a Global Project. Check the Superbug Network to contribute to the project and collect rewards.

Bungle thinks that unwanted, animated hair should be a thing of the past. Collect data on that shaggy floor-worm, the pesky Monobeast! - and help develop a more modern, painless disposal method.\n\nThis project can be completed alone, but progress may be faster with contributions from another healthcare organisation.
Health Inspector Henry Jobsworth has penned an open letter in the Two Point Squabbler: "I believe that we may be misdiagnosing the condition known as "Love". Long believed to originate organically and incorporeally, it may, in fact, be an illness. If this proves to be the case, all previous health inspections would be null and void, and all healthcare would be required to stop, immediately, to allow for new inspections."\n\nIt's not as urgent as Henry makes it sound, as fortunately/unfortunately no one really listens to Mr Jobsworth at the ministry, but it's an interesting line of inquiry and it would really calm him down if we reached a conclusion on the matter. You'll need at least one other organisation to conduct this research.
The fine people at Bungle believe that Two Point County is leaving one of its largest resources untapped: the deceased population. They began toying with ways of putting the perished to work, but all plans were shelved. Help resurrect their plans, and the usefulness of our ancestors, to make the most of your organisation's less fortunate former patients.\n\nIt looks like this amount of work would be better suited for a few organisations.
The big cheeses at Cheesy Gubbins want to run the most comprehensive study in the history of  cheese "to understand the sacred balance between man and cheese, for the betterment of all Two Point County, and to dictate the future of the gubbin".\n\nThey require substantial research into the constitution of the Pointian, as well as how it responds to, and how its been shaped by, cheese. Who'd have thought there was so much to know about cheese?... The people at Cheesy Gubbins, I guess.
The story goes that one night, late at Bungle HQ, Sophie Nova had a sequence of words flow through her and onto her Bureaucats notepad: "machines what think if could". She was convinced that there was a significant idea in there somewhere, but couldn't decipher her own moment of inspiration. Several years and thousands of notepads later, the sequence would unscramble itself before her eyes: "what if machines could think"...\n\nIt's been Sophie's pet project ever since, but it's been nothing more than a pipedream, until now. A huge amount of varied data needs to be gathered in order to create artificial intelligence capable of working in healthcare.

The Superbug Initiative are happy to announce that another project has been completed.\n\nCongratulations on a successful contribution to the development of Two Point County.\n\nToday marks a long overdue victory over the Monobeasts. I am, personally, extremely relieved.
The Superbug Initiative are happy to announce that another project has been completed.\n\nCongratulations on a successful contribution to the development of Two Point County.\n\n"Love" has been classified: NOT AN ILLNESS. I got in touch with Mr Jobsworth to give him the news, but he had no idea what I was talking about.
The Superbug Initiative are happy to announce that another project has been completed.\n\nCongratulations on a successful contribution to the development of Two Point County.\n\nWe've improved the functionality of the deceased. We can only hope that this is what they'd have wanted.
The Superbug Initiative are happy to announce that another project has been completed.\n\nCongratulations on a successful contribution to the development of Two Point County.\n\nWe now know more about cheese than any civilised society has ever known about cheese. Cheesy Gubbins has slightly modified their 500 year plan to reflect the research. They're so please that they've sent you all a commemorative plinth.
The Superbug Initiative are happy to announce that another project has been completed.\n\nCongratulations on a successful contribution to the development of Two Point County.\n\nOur new AI has already started telling jokes and asking questions. I'm sure we'll look back on this day fondly, and not as the beginning of the end…

Welcome to another beautiful day in Two Point County. If you find yourself in Lower Bullocks this morning, don't forget it's 'Hug-a-Hog' day down at Merrydung Farm-
‐which is why the human species is doomed. Meanwhile, fresh snow has fallen on the Pointy Mountains. Not so great news for researchers at the medical campus, whose lab equipment has frozen again‐
‐they might count themselves lucky they're not employed at the Melt Downs, where a small industrial incident has taken local temperatures to record highs‐
‐Sweaty Palms recorded its fifth earthquake of the year, would you believe it? Apparently, the shocks were felt all the way in Grockle Bay Zoo, but it's said the animals are doing just fine‐
‐the Croquembouche stock market showed corporate giants Jumbo still leading the way, despite stiff competition from its rivals. Well, their company motto is "crush all opposition", after all‐
‐so we turn our attention to Hogsport, where we have just learned that our esteemed Health and Safety inspector, Henry Jobsworth, has approved the opening of a new hospital. We shall follow its progress with interest… and do to remember to listen to Two Point Radio for all the latest County news.

Sufferers exhibit dangerously low levels of pixel density and an unhealthy longing for the recent past. Caused by bytes from low-res spiders.
8-bitten
Caused by mutated pheromones and/or cheap deodorant.
Animal Magnetism
Bard Flu
A psychiatric condition caused by too much bottom sniffing.
Barking Mad
A quite alarming contortion of the face, caused by sleeping at a strange angle. Doctors recommend always using a bed protractor to monitor your sleeping angles.
Bed Face
A severe boggling of the mind. Often caused by exposure to new, sometimes paradigm-altering, information. Through careful analysis of this condition, scientists have been able to derive the equation: Mind = Blown. Sadly this equation has proven to be entirely useless.
Blown Mind
Boggled Mind
A rather disgusting skin condition caused by filthy toilets. It can be cured with an expensive cocktail of drugs carefully prepared in the Pharmacy. Or with witchcraft.
Bogwarts
A condition that renders the face defective. Notable causes include: daydreaming, faulty radishes and high-velocity cricket balls.
Broken Face
Also known as 'toilet enthusiasm', the sufferer always seems to want to know where the nearest toilet is.
Bum Rush
Requires an injection.
Burping Fever
Requires an injection.
Chronic Flatulence
Once this grips a patient it doesn’t let go. Afflicts many living statues and selfie-taking chumps.
Clamp
A condition that causes high jinks and general buffoonery. Escaped clowns must have their sense-of-humour completely excised to prevent a future relapse.
Clown Complex
Skeletal rage, sometimes triggered by piracy. Requires a Fracture Ward.
Cross Bones
A common illness in those visiting art galleries, cubism spreads on contact with canvas. Interestingly, Impressionists are believed to be genetically immune to it.
Cubism
Every now and then something unusual happens and we're not sure why. Luckily enough, this vague and mysterious condition can be treated in a Ward.\nStill, what are the chances?...
Anomalitis
Sufferers experience vivid and colourful dreams that cause raucous snoring. They must be cured of these hugely positive experiences in order to keep the volume down.
Aurora Snorealis
Sufferers begin using typically Elizabethan language incorrectly and out of context, as well as adopting certain physical anachronisms. Caused by goose fat-stuffed trousers, rotten fruit and being pursued by bears. 
Bard Flu
Sufferers are convinced that they're canine. Common causes include trying dog biscuits and the slippery slope of going to the bathroom outside.
Barking Mad
Caused by a low-acid diet that leads to simplistic and culturally derivative behaviour. A popular treatment involves a mixture of lemon juice and chemicals that promote individuality. 
Basic
Prolonged lying and unpreparedness have caused a deposit of oatmeal, onions and a variety of spices in the stomach. The mixture must be removed by a surgeon before the heart, lungs and other organs dislodge themselves and enter the stomach, completing the fatal, albeit resourceful, recipe.
Blaggis
The overburdened psyche must be burst and then reconstituted using very clever therapy.
Bloaty Dread
The upper leg has become soft and gelatinous. The bones need to be regrown and set in a Fracture Ward.
Boneless Thighs
An unhealthy habit of repressing thoughts has led to a build up of mind-numbing gas, causing clumsy mistakes, face flatulence and erroneous comments.
Brain Farts
A condition characterised by flashbacks and ice cream-headaches, often caused by bad experiences with yellow snow. Once a psychiatrist has tricked them into forgetting the memories forever, everything will be alright. 
Brain Freeze
Apathy and general woodenness caused by a surplus of cheese in the system, which must now be removed.
Cheese Bored
A form of shoulder pain, or discomfort, due to thermal or emotional coldness. Caused by a lack of eye contact, withheld jumpers or brief texts. The best treatment is thought to be five parts cough syrup to one part anti-freeze.
Cold Shoulder
The blood has separated into its components, becoming lumpy and dangerously useless. Sufferers must receive an emulsifying injection in order to stay alive.
Curdled Blood
The patient’s arm requires restructuring and resuscitation in a Fracture Ward.
Dead Arm
The various glands of the body have gone rogue, switching places and now work as poorly as you'd expect. A surgeon must go in and rearrange everything to prevent any further damage.
Displaced Glands
Excessive amounts of pine-scented freshness in the body have altered the DNA. The sufferer needs to stay away from forests and car fresheners, and be taken for treatment in a DNA lab.
Evergreen
The eye has begun to secrete a hard, sugary substance. Caused by looking at the visually appealing and eating too much fudge.
Eye Candy
Recurring collisions with the ground have caused microscopic moss to grow on the person's face.
Face Plant
Sufferers are likely to be groan-ier than usual, unresponsive and, temporarily, up to 8ft tall. Several cured patients have noted that, while afflicted, they felt as though parts of their body weren't their own. Caused by watching old horror films, Gothic literature and identity crises.
Monster Mishmash
A condition most common in the outskirts of Two Point County. Believed to stem from a longing for a life in 'the big city', sufferers act out, what they naively believe to be, a typical city lifestyle. Metropolism manifests itself in two main strains, this is its 'Reptilian' form.
Reptilian Metropolism
Excessive self-indulgence has led to a build-up of materialised self-worth, blocking the sufferer's internal systems and making them insufferable to be around. The slime must be removed from their system - and their general vibe - for everyone's sake.
Goobris
Tests to a sufferer of this condition reveal that they're genetically half human and half pipe, but, other than that, there are no signs of the potentially fatal illness. In fact, the lack of symptoms led to ground-breaking research which found that humans and pipes are actually 99.1% genetically identical. Caused by unstuck landings and misguided attempts at plumbing.
Half Pipe
Overexposure to the housing market has resulted in an unhealthy relationship with territory, as well as fixations on water pressure and curtains.
Hyperrealty
Parts of the body are facing the wrong way, at 90, and in some cases 180, degrees to their usual position. Caused by a failed attempt to rotate in the air whilst on a snowboard, thus inverting the body's 1080.
Inverted 1080
Sufferers seek solace from their bad dreams, and the problems that have caused them, in chainmail, gauntlets and outrageously loud shoes. They must be coaxed out of their tin suit of denial, even if it is surprisingly slimming.
Knightmares
A condition caused by poorly worded questions and misheard TV quizzes. The sufferer is unable to make sense of basic cause and effect, therefore they need treatment. Like that… they wouldn’t have understood that.
Logic Problem
The elbow has shattered like a broken mirror, how sinister.
Menace Elbow
Sufferers believe that they're being bothered by spirits from the world of the dead, and it's really getting on their nerves. A psychiatrist conducts an advanced form of relationship counselling so that the spirits and the patient are able to get on better.
Paranoyance
A lack of stimulation has sent the motor and verbal systems into a tail-spin, making the sufferer do and say increasingly dull things, they must be helped before they bore themselves to death.
Pathological Tediousness
An ancient affliction said to come from small pieces of antler getting into the water supply. Sufferers display bouts of rage, sometimes butting heads, but more commonly just complain and shout a lot.
Rantlers
A condition most common in the outskirts of Two Point County. Believed to stem from a longing for a life in 'the big city', sufferers act out, what they naively believe to be, a typical city lifestyle. Metropolism manifests itself in two main strains, this is its 'Mechanical' form.
Mechanical Metropolism
Symptoms include: Discomfort in both shins after beginning a meal, as well as a faint cheesy smell emanating from the kneecaps.
Shin Blintz
Areas of the brain have begun to pickle, often caused by drinking the primitive and potent beverages distributed during festivities in the mountain towns of Two Point County.
Skull Chutney
A condition at one time known as "The Snowball Effect". An initial bad decision has harmed the sufferer's judgement, leading to worse decisions that cause increasingly significant damage. The sufferer's judgement needs rehabilitation and recuperation in a hospital bed to avoid 'Snowballing' any further.
Sore Judgement
A condition characterised by teeth that are partially constituted of nougat. Sufferers must be given the most powerful mouth-wash in the world.
Sweet Teeth
A condition that stays dormant for years before surfacing, and often never surfaces at all. This ancient gene, most commonly found in people from around the Pointy Mountains, causes the, now patterned, skin to take on a woollen texture.
Tartan Telomeres
Caused by exposure to bad news and icy winds, sufferers, who exhibit increased sensitivity to the cold, as well as occasional leaking, need a skin-fortifying injection, and to be told something nice about themselves.
Thin Skinned
It's clear how this happened. Patients require treatment in a Ward.
Tongue Splinters
Recurrent bafflement has caused a build-up of extremely dense negative feelings. The heavy head must be removed, and a lighter, less tormented replacement attached, whilst the sufferer can still carry its weight.
Screwball
Most commonly caused by falling asleep on the sand only to have a nightmare. The sufferer hears, and sometimes mimics, a throaty, warbling melody.
Beach Wail
The sufferer's facial features have receded out of existence and must be coaxed back with subtle, hydraulic machinery. Unfortunately common amongst people-pleasers, yes-men and crowd-enthusiasts.
Blank Look

Boxer
Repressed thoughts and stifled 'wind' have led to the build-up of a mind-numbing gas, causing clumsy mistakes, face flatulence and erroneous comments. The gas must be re-rerouted through the body before the pressure becomes too much and the head explodes.
Brain Farts
Sufferers are haunted by 'the call of the ocean', despite no previous experience of, nor association with, life at sea. Caused by listening to shells and second-hand earrings. 
Buccanear
A regionally specific form of avian-turmoil. Sufferers start by dressing flamboyantly, moving on to clothes laced with feathers, and, eventually, to fully-fledged bird suits. Requires treatment before they attempt to fly from a great height or sit on some eggs.
Budgie Struggler
The sufferer's toes have fused into two distinct sections, well-suited for movement across the dunes, but un-ideal in essentially every other way. Contracted from camel-infested sand.
Camel Toe
Caused by a microscopic fungus found in the island's soil, the sufferer's ears have crusted over with plant matter. They need to be given a particular, human-friendly, form of weed killer to recover auditory and aesthetic normalcy. 
Cauliflower Ears
The sufferer's exterior has become crunchy, in places. Caused by using marinade instead of sun cream.
Crispy Skin
Sufferers are filled, to capacity, with pudding. They must be treated before their insides burst. A condition particularly rife in the area, due to the island's excellent ice cream. Holidaymakers, given an afternoon to their own devices, will seek comfort in frozen custard.
Desserted
Prolonged feelings of sameness have led to dull, tedious pain and a craving for adventure. The sufferer's tendency to search for relief in highly precarious, unimaginative, activities mean that they pose a great risk to themselves and others until they experience some kind of payoff.
Wanderust
A mutation characterised by a lurid tinging of the skin. Caused by malevolent practices, archaic rituals or potent cosmetic sprays. The body needs to be purged of this deceptive abnormality before the heart shrivels and darkens to a roasted, orange hue.
False Tan
A fungal infection often contracted from fake jewellery and magic beans. Treatments designed to solely fight the fungus have given way, in recent times, to blends that also stimulate the body's common sense facilities.
Fool's Mould
Recognition for increasingly peripheral aspects of football have turned a passion for the game into an obsession. Sufferers exhibit, above everything else, a heightened appreciation for set-piece efficacy, and must be sent for therapy before all their faculties are totally overrun by sporting minutia.
Football Crazy
Excessive time in the fine weather has caused the individual to become unreasonably and deliriously friendly. They must be sent for treatment before they faint, overheat or make more friendships than they can sustain.
Heat Wave
An obsessive fondness for their beach towel has taken a dark turn, and they now seek other, larger beach towels in which to engulf themselves. Competition for towels amongst sufferers can be fierce, so those without a towel might be found in reclusive solitude, often in lighthouses. 
Hermitism
Highly affecting stimuli have caused the sufferer's feelings to congeal, blocking the body's sensory circulation. Mood swings, from severe numbness to sensitivity, will persist, until the deposits of solid sentiment are removed from the system.
Jellied Feels
The fact often remains hidden for years , but an individual with this condition is actually part plane. It will likely make a great deal of sense in retrospect, as they recall being unusually fast children. Should be treated to avoid dealing with engine failure or oil issues in later life.
Jet Leg
The exposed knees have begun to succumb to the elements, turning pointy and misshapen. Caused by excessive shorts-wearing.
Knobbly Knee
A high-citrus diet has begun to cure the body's more enigmatic components. Oh, and that's cure as in 'cook', not 'fix'. Just to be clear: this is an illness, not a good thing.
Lemon Soul
A phenomenon that can occur when climbing in one of the island's many fruit trees. If a branch breaks, sometimes an individual breaks one or multiple limbs out of sheer compassion for the tree, or it might happen when they hit the ground. Medical science is yet to reach a consensus.
Limb Empathy
Sufferers exhibit a minorly impaired gait after being slightly hobbled by slipping on a mollusc.
Limpette
A condition caused by poorly worded questions and misheard TV quizzes. The sufferer is unable to make sense of basic cause and effect, therefore they need treatment. Like that… they wouldn't have understood that.
Logic Problem
The neck and lower-face have become loose and need to be pharmaceutically re-tightened before they fall off. Caused by talking nonsense, chewing on prunes or a gasp-heavy daily routine.
Loose Jowels
A crippling lack of direction has led to a deranged, costumed, desire to be told what to do by a supreme authority figure. Once they've been convinced that they're not from an ancient civilisation, sufferers need to be helped with the pressures of modern life.
Nerological Imbalance
The outermost membrane has become less selective. Early signs include: surface moisture, minor dripping and puddle formations. Needs to be corrected before all of their innards move outwards.
Oozmosis
You're not supposed to eat the really spikey part of the fruit, or of anything really, that should be self-explanatory. When you do, this is what happens to you. The tiny shards of organic shrapnel combine with the fruit's characteristic tartness to create significant discomfort.
Painapple

Parakeet
Overwhelmed by how calm life can be away from the mainland, the body has been sent into a state of shock and total chemical imbalance. Sufferers must be stabilised before they shut down.
Placid Reflux

Ruptured Testudo
Parts of the body, so dried out by sand, have begun to crack, crumble and disintegrate entirely. Sufferers need to be chemically rehydrated with... water, mostly.
Sandy Crack
Caused by feelings of paranoia and general distrust. Sufferers are wary of their own silhouette, responding to sudden movements and changes in light with dextrous footwork and skittish violence. Common in athletes in the lead up on a 'big fight'. Treatment can be aided by lying them down in a bed, thereby disconnecting their feet from the 'feet of their shadow'. Really, it helps.
Shadow Boxer
Poor dental hygiene has led to revolting teeth with a tendency to revolt.
Tooth Mutiny
An onset of panic, caused by high levels of atmospheric moisture, have caused the sufferer to confess all of their darkest secrets. A psychiatrist must convince them to shut up, and cool down, before they ruin their life.
Trumidity
Tiny, smartly-dressed bugs, believed to be the classy relatives of the common flea, are throwing a microscopic soirée on, or within, the body of the afflicted. 
Vested Insects
An airborne affliction contracted from one of the island's more intoxicating plants. Sufferers may seem a little... off, behaving recklessly or, at worse, acting totally feral.
Wild Spore
Sufferers are chiefly characterised by having a large, ant-like head in place of their own. Should be treated with a mixture of bug repellent and mashed potatoes. Caused by bites from radioactive ants or failure to clear a teleporter before use.
Anty Matter
Sufferers exhibit a sensitive, fluorescent area of inflammation. Caused by crops being contaminated with space dust, making them too volatile for consumption. Requires treatment with anti-inflammatory bum-salve.
Asterrhoids
Aliens from other planets have heard about Two Point County and don't want to miss out. They've travelled light-years for the things that you and I take for granted. Though not strictly a disease, they need to be treated to live the earthy lives of their inter-galactic dreams.
Lack of Humanity
Parts of the body's internal structure have intertwined into complex orbital structures and require untying. Caused by gone off space food and trying to understand astrophysics.
Astroknot
A condition caused by cramped transport or losing battles with 'easy-build' wardrobes. Sufferers need to be rebuilt from this simplified, condensed state.
Flat-Packed
Unwanted knowledge of classified information has caused alarming levels of teeth gritting and tongue biting. The teeth have become tense and dissociated from the rest of the body and feel like an entirely separate, potentially detachable, entity. The sufferer requires therapy to reacquaint themselves with their own mouth.
Confidentures
The sufferer's thumb has an incredible range of movement. It's possible that it could come in handy - get it, handy? - but mainly it's just really painful and needs fixing.
Continuthumb
The sufferer has a parasitic space moss growing inside of them. They will experience intermittent moments of cosmic peace, before a painful death. Requires treating with, either, the sap of an ancient moon tree or domestic weed killer.
Cosmoss
Sufferers have become unenamoured with being human. Rather than deal with their issues, they hang out in fields and pretend to be cows. Must be treated quickly, before they're abducted by cow-collecting aliens.
Bowhine
An unhealthy enthusiasm for 'sci-fi' has caused the sufferer to trap themselves in a makeshift costume of a, supposedly, popular character. They require treatment before they lose what's left of them and end up looking like that forever. I mean, look at them.
Space Caged
Sufferers need to wear protective clothing due to being 'ill-suited' to Two Point County'. With a course of medicinal therapy and a nice lie down, patients can become acclimated. Deeply Ill-Suited patients are sealed in a water-tight environment to keep out the County's atmosphere.
Deeply Ill-Suited
The body contains a small, surplus, celestial organ. The "terrestical" should be removed to avoid future complications, such an involuntary gravitational collapse. 
Extraterrestical
The sufferer's mouth exhibits signs of abnormal density, producing words at a pathological, extremely irritating, rate. Peace and quiet are out of the question until the condition is treated. Caused by thought provoking mini series and mind-bending space fruits. 
Flack Hole
Years ago an alien life-form scanned the universe to find its closest genetic relative and found the frogs of Earth. They planned to visit their relative, and to take on their form, so as not to alarm anyone, but arrived without an escape plan or looking into the social status and engineering capabilities of the common frog. Generations later, these aliens are sick of being stuck here, so they've devised human-style outer shells to transport them to labs and hospitals, so they can be changed back into their true form and then go home.
Frogborne
The sufferer's genetic common-sense has begun to faulter. Newly produced cells now lack the "gorm" gene entirely. They must undergo treatment before becoming irrevocably foolish.
Gorm Deficiency
Also know as the 'Henchman Phenomenon', a fault in the DNA has caused the sufferer's motivation to become straightforward and one dimensional. They must undergo treatment before someone with the wrong idea takes advantage.
Grunt
Stands for something. Swelling caused by an unhealthy fear of alien invasion or taking the radio too seriously.
H. G. Swells
Nausea induced by being a long way from home, or, sometimes, an allergic reaction to houses in Two Point County. Sufferers require a treatment that resets their concept of 'home' and accustoms them to drywall and throw pillows.
Home Sick
An infection of the eye caused by dirty telescopes, binoculars or space goggles. Sufferers predict upsetting events and see really off-putting things.
Horrorscope
Overexposure to the housing market has left the sufferer with an unhealthy relationship with territory, as well as fixations on water pressure and curtains. Their obsession with fabrics must be removed from the fabric of their being.
Hyperrealty
The sufferer has begun to become an all-but-identical variation of themselves. Caused by exposure to, and the subsequent absorption of, trends and idioms. Needs to be treated before they become too irritating or dangerously radioactive.
Isotrope
Microscopic space parasites have claimed the sufferer as their new home. The bugs' development occurs on an advanced time-frame so the sufferer must be treated with medicine that makes their body an unfit host before the mites' civilisation reaches the 'Apocalyptic Age'.
Meteormites
Blistering caused by going sockless in new shoes or irregular subatomic activity around the ankles. Unusually common in people adjusting to the footwear conventions of a new solar system. 
Neutrainers
A point of incredible density has formed a ring inside the body, made of breadcrumbs and space rocks, that's swirling around all over the place. A surgeon must siphon out the density, and give their innards a good vacuuming, before they turn inside-out. Caused by bootlegged jelly beans and indigestion at warp-speed.
Planetary Ring
A condition caused by an infestation of airborne space ticks. The host takes on the ticks' love of flying, and can be seen wearing silly propeller hats or jumping, optimistically, from small heights believing that they're "learning to glide".
Fanatick
An allergic reaction to G-force has caused the sufferer to reject their environment. Caused by riding roller coasters during pollen season or sneezing at the wrong moment during re-entry.
Aller-Gs
The sufferer is trapped in a form-fitting, silver suit and must be treated before they erode from chafing. Caused by an admirable, ill-conceived desire to take fashion into the future - today!
Science Friction
A condition that creates a localised microgravity environment within the body. The organs float freely and peacefully around the body: it is incredibly dangerous. The airlock must be broken and the atmosphere reset. Caused by space hiccups and an inability to deal with grave situations.
Situational Gravity
Sufferers need to wear protective clothing due to being 'ill-suited' to Two Point County. With a course of medicinal therapy and a nice lie down, patients can become acclimated. Highly Ill-Suited patients are sealed in an air-tight environment to keep out the County's atmosphere.
Highly Ill-Suited
A locking of the neck that shifts with the phases of the moon. Caused by looking directly upwards at stars, planets or satellites.
Sputneck
Impact with rogue star fragments has resulted in bodily fractures. Most common in those people who tend to know when the next eclipse is going to be.
Star Struck
Sufferers believe, or want to believe, that they can help society on a level above recycling and door-holding. Caused by commercial cinema and the grind of the everyday. Needs to be treated before they, inevitably, lose the fight against crime.
Hero Complex
Parts of the sufferer have been lost during trans-galactic teleportation. The body that remains is a temporary, fail-state, version of the individual pre-travel. They must now undergo DNA recovery so the original can be extrapolated from what remains.
Telemutation
The sufferer's insides have curved like wet wood. Caused by faulty space travel and unseasonably wet autumns.
Warped
The body has fallen out of its celestial cadence, or something, thus explaining why everything has been going badly. Caused by losing contact with the moon, red meat and inhaling fortune cookies three-abreast.
Zodiac Arrest
The sufferer's hands have become soft and mushy, much like the flesh of an avocado, causing them to break and fall apart at even the most mush-friendly tasks. Caused by early morning gentrification and shortening it to "avo".
Avocado Hands
An aggressive weasel-borne bacteria that lays dormant in organic fruit and vegetables, before attacking the system of unsuspecting saladeers. The DNA must be treated with the horrible, plant-cleaning chemicals that, unfortunately, would have prevented this from happening in the first place.
Bioweasel
Some of the body’s glands have begun secreting tiny stones. How did they get there? What are they for? These are questions that science continues to ask itself. Caused by admiring nature at particular times of year.
Bodily Druids
A spark, as can happen, has lead to a fire. Caused by a deep passion for anything or anyone, chewing on dried grass and playing one's stomach like the bellows.
Burning Desire
Formerly termed Sooty Foot, this condition causes a discharge of smokey residue around the feet and ankles. The sufferer's DNA must be examined, and the problem removed from the chain for good. Caused by eating burnt toast, playing with matches and not doing your part.
Carbon Footprint
An accident caused by long drives, big sneezes and undercooked camp meat. The afflicted need a change of clothes and someone to tell them that it happens to the best of us.
Chocolate Shorts
Sufferers are unable to keep track of a single idea. Scans will show that their thoughts have holes in them, which explains why they were talking all that rubbish. It's believed that sufferers don colanders on their heads as an expression of their state of mind, or, perhaps, just because they've lost it, a bit.
Perforated Thoughts
The sufferer, unable to deal with complex, hoppy situations, has been bottling up their emotions, which must now be removed, surgically, and distributed to people that deal in that kind of thing.
Craft Ailment
Mysterious glass-like spheres have materialised in the body. This could mean one of a number of things: success in business or romance; grave danger; or low, low prices. They need removing by a surgeon before they break and cause terrible luck as well as untold physical damage.
Crystal Balls
A condition that used to be treated with an array of tiny fans is now best handled by ingesting a pharmaceutical blend of sherbet flavoured eye drops and self-dazing flour.
Diluted Pupils
Pockets of climate-related dread have begun to attack the self. Sufferers just need a psychiatrist to lie to them for a while, then everything should be fine. Well, not fine, but you know.
Eco-Worrier
Derived from the old expression ("a bit of a Flappy Hamper"), the term is most commonly used in a medical setting to characterise the range of injuries that can be caused by the extremities being shut in wicker baskets. Caused by windy picnic and bad timing.
Flappy Hamper
Sufferers displace their environmental anxieties onto domestic gardening, taking obsessive care over carnations and chrysanthemums to make up for what they can't control. Common symptoms, other than its namesake head-pot, include: night-time weeding, fertiliser pockets and bloodshot eyes.
Pothead
An infection of the judgement gland, caused by double yolks and too many group chats. Sufferers will keep saying the wrong thing, and must be cured before they really blow it and swallow themselves whole.
Foot-in-Mouth
Unlike the figurative description of those who quite like gardening, this condition causes literal green-ness of the hands. Sufferers engage, obsessively, in gardening related activities and must be cured before they bury themselves in rakes, seed packets and, eventually, soil.
Green Fingers
The condition is characterised by a pattern of eccentric behaviour and ill-conceived decisions, as well as having a rabbit-like head. Caused by hare allergies, devilish lettuce and all night tea parties.
Harebrained
A chronic lack of subtlety that can cause swelling and increased density of the sufferer's hand-meat, a product of over simplifying arguments and misreading tsp as tbsp. Their internal sensitivity needs recalibrating in order to alleviate the problem, and the strain of lugging around those weighty manuals.
Heavyhandedness
A negative reaction to fragrant smoke has left the sufferer anything but relaxed. They need to be calmed down with a sophisticated blend of aromas, specially catered to their needs.
Incensed
Fantasy role playing games have left the sufferer paranoid about their vulnerability to wizardry, give them an untraceably small dose of something and tell them it’s magic.
Mage Fright
The stomach is lined with a layer of leaves and woodchips. Symptoms include: unusual rustling and forest floor smell. Caused by ingesting topsoil and general foliage. Sufferers should be told to wash their vegetables and fungi before eating them, not after.
Mulch
So-called as the fracturing is a result of a nasty trip. Caused by poor coordination, unseen tree roots and getting distracted by illusionary posters. 
Nasty Trip
A condition that causes the sufferer to become a real nuisance. The irritation can take on countless forms, from deliberately clapping at the wrong time, to throwing out perfectly good bread. Commonly contracted from aphids, voles or passed, directly, from someone that's both sickeningly tiresome and tiresomely sick.
Pesticitis
The sufferer is all bent out of shape after bouncing off a piece of woodland. Trees always win, folks.
Pine Dented
Woodworms, loaded with F.I.B. (Falsification Inducing Bacteria), take up residence in an unsuspecting human. The host becomes stiff and wooden, lies to anyone that's willing to listen, and externalises their own conscience. They'll need treatment to feel real again.
Woodworms
Sufferers are stuck, or 'shackled', as a faunier form of themselves, and may exhibit uncharacteristically mischevious or horn-ful behaviour. Needs to be treated with an especially disgusting type of medicine, known as an 'antigoat'. Luckily, sufferers can eat just about anything…
Ramshackled
An immersive, hallucinatory form of nostalgia that causes the sufferer to see things the way that they think they used to be, often in a warming, sepia hue. Caused by new, generally less bad, problems, and irregular celestial activity. They need to receive a course of therapy that will show them that things weren't that great then, either.
Retrogaze
The sufferer's bowels have become upset from too much travel. They need medicine that makes their constitution feel at home, so they can, once again, travel comfortably and lightly.
Roadstool
An extreme form of hay fever, the condition leaves sufferers itchy, upset and capable of defending crops from all manner of avian treachery. Oh yeah, and they've turned into straw… I always forget that part.
Distrawed
The sufferer is having trouble in the toilet-department after being on the wrong end of a constipation incantation. They say the darkest magic hits you where the sun don't shine.
Spellbound
A condition caused by the heated debate surrounding the humble, miniature cabbage. Sufferers have been worn down by unsustainable exposure to the sheer volume of opinions. We can treat them, but this only ends when people realise that there are more interesting things to talk about.
Sproutrage
Characterised by bouts of bumbling, cringeworthy foolishness. The sufferer's DNA has been altered after years of trying to seem as if they know what they're doing, despite being well out of their depth. The ineptitude must be genetically removed before they take the rest of us down with them.
Stumblebum
The sufferer has been corrupted by flawed, obsolete or malware ridden technology and needs to be treated with an emergency software update. Caused by hyper-connectivity and using your phone on the toilet.
Glitchy Patch
Sufferers are characterised by a stifling soreness and a slightly flinty smell. Commonly caused by long camping trips, spent trying to start fires.
Tenderbox
An infection that transmogrifies the nose, turning the sufferer into a big ol' turnip face. Those afflicted should be warned about burying their heads in the soil or doing that impression of a truffle pig which everyone likes so much.
Root Snoot
Sustained sobbing has left the sufferer with a leaky aperture, or two. They require cheering up, and a chemical treatment that tightens the body's plumbing.
Weeping Iris
An unpleasant rash triggered when the sufferer is forced to make a decision too quickly.
Decision Rash
Skin has the appearance of denim. Causes a great deal of irritation, mainly due to the time it takes to dry after a shower. Believed to be caused by Bungle's genetically-engineered jeans, which have since been recalled.
Denim Genes
This is what happens if you simultaneously put a knife in a toaster and a fork in a power socket.
Shock Horror
Patients believe they are clothed. They are in for a nude awakening.
Emperor's Syndrome
Emperor Complex
A genetic condition.
Flatulent DNA
Caused by an overinflated ego.
Floaty Head
Caused by excessive physical activity. Requires a Fracture Ward.
Floppy Arm
A spinal discombobulation that leaves the sufferer with very limited memory.
Floppy Discs
A most unfortunate genetic condition. Although the flumps can be removed, they frequently grow back. Genetic recombobulation is usually the only option.
Flumps
Frankenstein
A tendency to pout excessively when faced with a camera. Caused by a build up of lewd thoughts in the cerebral cortex. A psychiatrist must use a subconscious tap to drain the excess thoughts into a beaker, after which they can be safely disposed of in an incinerator.
Freudian Lips
Eerie thoughts have carved out and replaced all of the important, gooey parts of the inner face. A light emits through the eyes, nose and mouth that, like the sufferer, is more than a little dim. Not to be mistaken for Squashed Head.
Frightheadedness
A genetic condition.
Genetic Gurning
A genetic condition.
Genetic Mumps
Existential despair frequently leads to a loss of colour. Requires Chromatherapy.
Grey Anatomy
Grout is frequently transmitted in bathrooms, and modern medication is effective, unlike earlier times, when it had to be dug out painfully with a screwdriver.
Grout
A quite unfortunate condition that has to be seen to be believed. But also cannot be unseen. Just don't look at it. Trust me.
Gurning Loins
Painfully attractive. Often leads to heart ache. Requires surgery to make the sufferer as repulsive as possible.
Heart Throb
An injury caused by too much hipping and hopping to young people's music. Requires treatment in a Fracture Ward.
Hop Hip
Patients are really not amused by this injury of the upper arm.
Humerus Injury
Caused by excessive physical activity. Requires a Fracture Ward.
Hurty Leg
Constantly looking for entertainment, food or drink. A psychiatric condition.
Hyper
A dangerous build up of narcissistic thoughts. If left untreated, parts of the ego begin to protrude from every orifice, which is highly unpleasant for anyone nearby. A psychiatrist must carefully deflate the ego using a massive pin.
Inflated Ego
A hand injury caused by too much enthusiastic thumb clicking, hand waving, and skin burns resulting from prolonged exposure to acid jazz.
Jazz Hand
Jest Infection
This condition can be traced back to the DNA Labs of Jumbo Mega Corp. Attempting to create a clone of himself that was twice as big, boss Jumbo McNally inadvertently ended up creating hundreds of people with extra large DNA molecules squeezed into normal-sized bodies.
Jumbo DNA
Skeletal fatigue caused by a lack of calcium in the diet. Upon diagnosis, the patient should be immediately rushed to a ward where they must sleep for several days whilst being fed milk and cookies by a nurse.
Lazy Bones
A skin abnormality that has become quite fashionable in recent years. This mutation originated in the labs at Grockle Bay Zoo, after a scientist attempted to create a human-cat hybrid, the same incident that led to the related condition, Lion Head.
Leopard Skin
Lightheaded patients are notable due to their bulbous heads.
Lightheadedness
A bacterial infection that causes the sufferer to discard items at random.
Litter Bug
Once thought to be extinct, Lycanthropy is making a comeback in dangerous forests across the land. Sufferers get it from direct exposure to light from the full moon, or possibly from door handles. Research is ongoing to discover which.
Lycanthropy
Test Illness 1
Mark Test Illness
A psychiatric condition that causes the sufferer to perceive things that don't exist, usually boxes within which they are trapped. Some scientists have speculated that the box may both exist and not exist, leading to the well known thought experiment, Schrodinger's Mime.
Mime Crisis
Chronic grumpiness due to a nihilistic semi-colon.
Misery Guts
Extreme hair growth, caused by excessive consumption of both highbrow and lowbrow entertainment. The monobrow must be carefully removed and placed in a secure container to prevent it from escaping.
Monobrow
A dangerous condition that causes the sufferer's health to deteriorate fast. Caused by paying too much attention to what other people think.
Mood Poisoning
Feet so grubby that the filth will never come out. Spreads germs like wildfire.
Mucky Feet
The afflicted have been wrapped for the afterlife by their families, but were only taking a nap. There are rituals, and the initial stages of embalming, to be undone.
Premature Mummification
A psychiatric condition leading to spontaneous outbreaks of dancing. Caused by prolonged exposure to mirrorballs.
Night Fever
Involuntary attachment to kitchen utensils, caused by extremely low levels of culinary skill. The pan must be carefully removed with a massive magnet.
Pandemic
Requires surgery in an Operating Theater.
Pelvic Gurning
The internal organs are arranged in such a way that they create dramatic music when the sufferer walks. Requires surgery to rearrange the organs.
Pipe Organs
Health is deteriorating fast. Requires an injection.
Poisoned
Portishead affects both body and mind. Once thought to be caused by proximity to sea air, it’s now known to be chiefly caused by living in Portishead.
Portishead
When the patient opens their mouth, terrible things happen. Caused by drinking water from a toilet sink, or a toilet.
Potty Mouth
Musings on the answer to football.
Tactics Board
The sufferer's head has been seized by a rare form of parasitic crustacean. Fortunately, a treatment is available that wrenches the creature from the victim, leaving their head healthy and uninfested.
Headcrabedness
A skin condition caused by dessert escaping into the blood stream. An anti-pudding gel must be injected into the patient.
Pudding Blood
Patients believe themselves to be one of the greatest rockstars the world has ever seen, but are sadly ga ga.
Mock Star

Shattered
An uncanny ability to predict the imminent onset of sickness. Caused by Sunday evenings.
Sick Sense
Requires a Ward. Takes a long time to treat.
Sloth Syndrome
Day dreaming gone bad. Requires a Ward.
Somnambulance
The vertebrae have become engulfed in dough. Can be the result of gardening accidents, but most commonly caused by eating too much bread, often several loaves over the recommended daily amount.
Spinal Bap
The sufferer has a tendency to, without prior warning or reasonable context, break into fits of rage, causing colleagues, passersby and loved ones to cry and/or soil themselves.
Spontaneous Combustion
Requires an injection.
Spontaneous Custard
A dangerous build up of dessert in the stomach, caused by eating pudding before your main meal. Requires surgery to remove the blockage.
Stomach Cake

Turn an aristocratic family’s spare castle into a hospital for the neighbouring mountain community.
Congratulations. Your hospital has been awarded a 1 Star rating by the Two Point Health Ministry.\n\nRemarkably, you’re only a few centuries late of finding yourself in a culturally relevant place. Debasing one of our most precious antiquities may disgust me, but you do seem to have a functional hospital on your hands, and I'm told that is "the point". Sigh.\n\nContinue to spit in the face of history for more rewards, or return to civilisation and get back to work.
Congratulations. Your hospital has been awarded a 2 Star rating by the Two Point Health Ministry.\n\nAs your newest hospital rises classlessly into administrative legitimacy, so too do the hallowed halls of Roquefort Castle become slowly, and all too surely, unrecognisable\n\n“Who does this benefit?”, I ask\n“The local population”, they reply.\nI ask again: “At what cost?”\n\nContinue to spit in the face of history for more rewards, or return to civilisation and get back to work.
Congratulations. Your hospital has been awarded a 3 Star rating by the Two Point Health Ministry.\n\nWell, you’ve done it, you’ve completed this monstrous corruption of our County’s past in the name of supposed ‘progress’.\n\nI overheard one of my subordinates remark that the castle has reached, through your hospital, the lofty heights of its yesteryear once again. The patent and amusing idiocy of this remark gave me some respite from the pain, if only for a sweet, fleeting moment.
Roquefort Castle
Welcome to Roquefort Castle, well, one of the Roquefort Castles. The aristocratic Roquefort family have kindly loaned us one of their castles to set up a hospital.\n\nThe family have also given us some technology that they commissioned to help revitalise party guests after their infamous cheese banquets. The Cryomatic may have been designed for wine-heads, but it's also found to have medical applications in this ghoulish part of the County.
Roquefort Castle
Run the medical facility of this much-maligned resort.
The hospital is up and running, now, the Bigfoot Foundation have acquired the technology to treat patients with Barking Mad and donated it to our organisation.
We're likely to receive some Barking Mad patients, a common ailment in this part of the County, but our organisation doesn't have any way of treating them. The Bigfoot Foundation have said that they'll invest in some equipment for us, once we get our first hospital off the ground.
The Nuts Mutts
Doghouse
Congratulations. Your hospital has been awarded a 1 Star rating by the Two Point Health Ministry.\n\nI will try to restrain my contempt for the service industry, for a moment, to say that I have enjoyed receiving fewer complaints about the state of that dreadful resort. Do give yourself an ovation, sedentary, standing or otherwise. We now return to our scheduled ribbing: they’ll have you turning down beds and waxing skis in no time, I’m sure. *Guffaw*\n\nContinue down the rabbit-hole of obscurity for more rewards, or return to civilization and get back to work.
Congratulations. Your hospital has been awarded a 2 Star rating by the Two Point Health Ministry.\n\nYou’re showing quite the knack for your new sector, aren’t you? I do hope that the glamour of key cards, miniature ablution aids and food on small, metallic trolleys doesn’t sway you away from us forever. I’m not sure if I’d recover. Oh, and don’t forget the pillow mints.\n\nContinue down the rabbit-hole of obscurity for more rewards, or return to civilization and get back to work.
Congratulations. Your hospital has been awarded a 3 Star rating by the Two Point Health Ministry.\n\nI find it very curious that you’ve decided to provide a third-rate hotel with a first-rate hospital. Perhaps you were hoping that the hotel might accrue quality through sheer proximity. Perhaps you just like developing high-quality hospitals. You know, the more that I think about it, the more that I think that, perhaps, I don’t care.

Event in Underlook
Welcome to Underlook. This Hotel & Resort suffers from misfortune and bad management, resulting in accidents, outbreaks of disease and unhappy guests. The owner is sick of negative reviews and diminishing profits, so they've set up a ‘medical emergency budget’ to salvage the hotel’s reputation and avoid any more lawsuits. You’ve been invited to run the resort’s brand-new medical facility.\n\nInstead of being paid for processing patients, you’ll be given money for completing targets set by the hotel, and receive a monthly performance bonus based on how successfully you've been treating guests. For the first three months, all of your running costs will be covered by your monthly bonus. As you’re a part of the hotel, you’ll have to contend with all of the bad press it receives: it might be worth investing in some marketing…

Revive this old research institute, based in the County's most remote town.
Congratulations. Your hospital has been awarded a 1 Star rating by the Two Point Health Ministry.\n\nI had thought that Swelbard was a fictional place, a mechanism with which one might tell a fantastical story, or frighten a miscreant child, so you can imagine my surprise when word reached me of your latest endeavour. Where next will you go: a municipality in the sky, some deserted island, the subterranean home of the mole-people? I would be unsurprised, knowing now that your thirst for the nonsensical knows no bounds.\n\nStay in fantasy-land for more rewards, or return to civilization and get back to work.
Congratulations. Your hospital has been awarded a 2 Star rating by the Two Point Health Ministry.\n\nThere is something quaintly admirable about your pioneering, single-minded spirit. That you should choose to ignore the location of civilised life and flippantly plant your flag in such lifeless and distant ground is a reminder of the vitality, instability and sheer stupidity so characteristic of our times.\n\nStay in fantasy-land for more rewards, or return to civilization and get back to work.
Congratulations. Your hospital has been awarded a 3 Star rating by the Two Point Health Ministry.\n\nWe, as administrators, are tasked with searching for the best place for each cog for the sake of the machine at large. I can see, now, that your reclusive research hospital is the perfect place, a safe-haven, for the inquisitive hermits amongst us. Properly utilising this peculiar resource should prove beneficial to our wider healthcare infrastructure. How delectably cunning.
Swelbard
Welcome to Swelbard, the most remote town in all of Two Point County. You’ve been invited to rejuvenate the Swelbard Research Institute by setting up a research hospital. As well as treating the area’s ills, you’ll need to complete some of the Institute’s outstanding research.\n\nSwelbard is an isolated place, so it may be difficult to find staff willing to come here. Any available candidates are likely to be unqualified, desperate, or unskilled townspeople that feel like pitching-in. You’ll need to train your faculty if you’re going to cure some mountain-people and salvage the Institute’s reputation from the academic toilet.
Swelbard Research Institute
The benefactors of the Institute have sent us a grant of <style="AdvisorHighlight">{[REWARDS]}</style> for completing some research! 
The benefactors of the Institute have sent us a grant of <style="AdvisorHighlight">{[REWARDS]}</style> for completing some training!
You really have done a great job, and thank you, again, for coming to the region at all.\n\nAs I believe I alluded to previously, the people of the Pointy Mountains aren't often paid much attention. I think the benefits of the care you have offered will be manifold and long-lasting.\n\nHopefully you enjoyed stretching your administrative legs.
Your friend,\nBartholomew F. Yeti
You didn’t just give the people of Swelbard the excellent healthcare that they deserve, you gave their town its identity back. I’ve got one more project lined up for you...\n\nI’ve been contacted by the Roquefort family, one of the oldest families in the County, and they’ve offered to let you use one of their spare castles. It seems that they’re still looking for some positive publicity in their community after centuries of feudalism, squalor and meanly-rationed wheat.\n\nYou’ll be providing healthcare for the mountain community that lives around the castle. I’m told that you should expect some castle-related idiosyncrasies: an unusual layout, unexplained drafts and the occasional - um, well - ghost apparently.\n\nBest of luck.
Your friend,\nBartholomew F. Yeti\n\nP.S. Gloves?...
I’m an ambassador for the Bigfoot Foundation, a group that helps preserve the Pointy Mountain region and support its mountain communities, often the most overlooked people in all of Two Point County - we weren’t even in the game until now…\n\nOur healthcare has been lagging behind for some time, and when I heard about the good work you’ve been doing down in the County, I thought I’d reach out and see whether you’d consider coming to the Pointy Mountains to treat people at a higher altitude?\n\nThe Underlook Hotel, the region’s biggest tourist hotspot, has recently been forced to introduce a ‘medical emergency budget’. I’ve spoken to the owner and he’s very keen for you to come and run the hotel’s newly opened hospital. What do you say?\n\nI look forward to hearing from you.
Your friend,\nBartholomew F. Yeti\n\nP.S. Pack a scarf.
I’m so pleased that you decided to come to our corner of Two Point County, Thank you! I’m not sure that they’ve ever had so many people visiting Underlook, and they’ve certainly never had so many people returning home, and it's all thanks to you.\n\nHelping a pillar of the region’s economy was a great start, and you’re beginning to gain a reputation. The benefactors of the Swelbard Research Institute have been in touch, in fact, they’ve asked if you’d consider converting the Institute into a hospital for our County’s most remote town. Whilst you’re there, why don’t you try and get their research off the ground again?\n\nKeep up the good work.
Your friend,\nBartholomew F. Yeti\n\nP.S. Bring a hat this time, too.

Now that the hospital is less filthy we're legally allowed to call it a hospital. Oh, and start doing medicine and all that.\n\nWe've also been sent the technology to treat patients with Blank Look, a disease we're likely to encounter while we're on the island.
Drawing a Blank
The most densely populated area of the island is hot, sticky and prone to extreme weather.
Congratulations. Your hospital has been awarded a 1 Star rating by the Two Point Health Ministry.\n\nWhen I was first informed of your arrival in Pebberley Reef, I feared the worst. That some kind of embarrassing, organisation-collapsing indecency had caused you to flee our shores. When I learned that you were, in fact, establishing a hospital, I understood you were merely suffering a breakdown. Needless to say, I’m thrilled and have stopped shredding my papers.\n\nContinue to luxuriate in the sand for more rewards, or return to the mainland and get back to work.
Congratulations. Your hospital has been awarded a 2 Star rating by the Two Point Health Ministry.\n\nI would love to encourage you to elongate your rehabilitative stay for as long as you feel is ‘necessary’. However, as much as I’d rather you were feeling better, the health of the county comes first and there’s plenty to do over here - I’d imagine. Besides, how much work could there possibly be in our County’s paradise?\n\nContinue to luxuriate in the sand for more rewards, or return to the mainland and get back to work.
Congratulations. Your hospital has been awarded a 3 Star rating by the Two Point Health Ministry.\n\nI cannot fault your commitment. You’ve certainly followed through on the bit. Pebberley now boasts a first-rate healthcare facility amidst its sandcastles and gentle, foamy swell, how positively charming for them…\nI hope that this concludes your little ordeal.
Pebberley Reef
Welcome to Pebberley Reef. Wigbert “Wiggy” Silverbottom has funded this hospital on the coast of Pebberley Island. Currently, we’re not exactly what you would term ‘official’. We’ll need to clean the place up a bit before the island’s medical authorities are willing to recognise this as a hospital and give us a medical license.\n\nWiggy’s using the hospital to make good on all those times he’s offered someone a job without thinking it through; for some reason he thought it’d be a good idea for them to work as our janitorial staff. We won’t have access to a pool of highly trained medical janitors. Instead, we’ll be able to hire other, random, totally inexperienced people. We’ll need to get training, or maybe just hire loads of them, as Pebberley receives some of the most erratic and unique weather in the County.
Pebberley Reef
Inclement weather knocked the peaks off of this mountain, leaving a series of hard to reach, deeply mysterious, plateaus.
Congratulations. Your hospital has been awarded a 1 Star rating by the Two Point Health Ministry.\n\nIt is clear to me, that any simpleton would understand that this piece of Pointian mythology was not described literally… I am deeply concerned that it should fall to me to inform you that when the legend speaks of “reinvigoration” it speaks figuratively and not of a magic potion. All the same, you have found it, for some reason. Enjoy your pretty, albeit totally ordinary, bit of water.\n\nContinue to muck about in some ruins for more rewards, or return to the mainland and get back to work.
Congratulations. Your hospital has been awarded a 2 Star rating by the Two Point Health Ministry.\n\nWell, well. I’m hearing that wave after wave of sickly visitors are finding their way to your hospital. The image this brings to mind is, while totally ridiculous, not altogether unsatisfactory. That is as complimentary as I’m willing to get on the matter, and, as a rule, ever.\n\nContinue to muck about in some ruins for more rewards, or return to the mainland and get back to work.
Congratulations. Your hospital has been awarded a 3 Star rating by the Two Point Health Ministry.\n\nSo, you’ve finished developing a world class hospital, on top of a mountain…You might want to think about demonstrating your ability in a less symbolically heavy-handed manner. Where next, a hospital on the moon? (Please don’t go to the moon).
Topless Mountain
Welcome to Topless Mountain. The incredible natural plateaus of this area are perfect building foundations. They’re just so flat. Much more suitable than those pointy Pointy mountains they have in the north. The ancient people certainly thought so, that’s why they did lots of building here back in the ancient times, with their ancient tools.\n\nThe transport out here is a nightmare, as you can imagine, and tourists that make it this far tend to have gotten sick on their travels, so big groups (we’re calling them ‘waves’) of sickly sightseers will be turning up all at once. Whilst you’re treating them, Wiggy’s crew will be excavating the ruins. It might be worth keeping an eye on their progress: the more they find, and restore, the more boneheads we’ll get turning up at the hospital.

Coexist with nature in an ancient, semi-sentient jungle.
Congratulations. Your hospital has been awarded a 1 Star rating by the Two Point Health Ministry.\n\nI have very little hope that this communication will reach you - you being where you are - however, it is part of my role as Health Minister to send these letters whenever the appropriate criteria have been met. Here goes: la-la, flip-tee-dee, bleh. And so on.\n\nContinue to lollygag in a jungle for more rewards, or return to the mainland and get back to work.
Congratulations. Your hospital has been awarded a 2 Star rating by the Two Point Health Ministry.\n\nIt is my understanding that, since the time of my last letter, your location has become drastically less remote, due to the growing reputation of your most recent ‘branch’ (a little arboricultural humour for you there). I might point out that this all seems a little outside the realm of your job description, but hey-ho. That’d mean me looking into it.\n\nContinue to lollygag in a jungle for more rewards, or return to the mainland and get back to work.
Congratulations. Your hospital has been awarded a 3 Star rating by the Two Point Health Ministry.\n\nIf you expect me to commend you on restoring the equilibrium of an ancient jungle, then you may be waiting some time, and I’d suggest that your understanding of my role is brutally, irreparably flawed. Nice hospital though.
Overgrowth
Welcome to Overgrowth. It’s hard to believe, but a community used to live at the heart of this jungle before it got angry with them and, you know, ‘over grew’. People who had lived here for millennia were forced to leave their home, and live down the road a bit.\n\nThe plants here are pretty judgemental, for vegetation, but might respond positively if you care for the people and restore balance to the area. When we arrived we found incomprehensible word and number sequences written into the bark of some of the trees. Try as we may, we just couldn’t make any sense of “Cure 10 Patients”, you should probably take a look. Good luck and, remember, the trees are watching!
Overgrowth
If you had told me that we’d find the treasure we so eagerly sought, only to find that a myth largely predicated on hearsay and dusty old bits of paper wasn’t totally factual or literal, I’d have assumed that I’d be disappointed, humiliated even. Instead, I confess, I’m rather tickled. I did like it there, lovely views and so on. There’s a lesson to be learned, I’m sure, but I’d rather move on, immediately, to something else.\n\nNow, Giles, let’s get home and start work on that time machine.
Wiggy Silverbottom & Giles
Ok Giles, take a letter. Are you listening, because I’m about to start talking? Giles? Giles! Ok, good.\n\nGreetings - find out their name - I hope you’re well, etc. etc. \n\nMy interests reside in the iconic, immortality granting spring that’s said to inhabit Pebberley Island. My research has identified three probable locations on the island. My chief-concern is that the island is filled with all-manner of diseases, most of which aren’t found on the mainland. YOU have been chosen to sterilise our path to the spring with some of your rather splendid hospitals.\n\nIn return, I offer you glory in your field: be a part of the greatest breakthrough in the history of healthcare, indeed, it’s very endpoint! Oh, and I’ll pay for your trip. We start our search in Pebberley Reef.\n\nAnd sign-off with whatever makes sense. Now, what’s for lunch?... Giles? Giles, why are you still writing? Giles. Giles!
Wiggy Silverbottom
Giles, you assured me that our research was totally comprehensive, that if this spring was on this island we would find it. So, I have decided, that if it’s not here, you won’t be returning with us to the mainland. It only seems fair, and I’m sure you’ll understand.\n\nNow, where was I? Ah yes. This may be your last time taking my dictation, Giles. Savour it.\n\nDear esteemed colleague. I hope you’re as excited for our final stop as I am. The ruins seem immensely promising. This will be it, I’m sure. As I speak - I mean write - I can positively taste the ineffable profundity of it all.\n\nExcellent. Now, why can’t I taste my tea, Giles, remind me?
Wiggy Silverbottom
Morale is paramount, Giles. It’s important that we don’t let them know how disappointing and fruitless our first stop was.\n\nLet’s start with… My friend, your performance outdid your already stellar reputation. Do not be disheartened, Pebberley Reef was the logical starting point, but only the beginning! We have great hopes for finding the spring on our next stop further inland. As they say, Hogsport wasn’t built in a day!... it took at least a few days, I’m sure.\n\nRace you to the jungle, eh! On that note, has accommodation been finalised for the next leg, Giles?

I remind you that I would refuse to receive any sensitive information, as I value our security, if anything, too much. So do tell those, I’m sure, lovely men in the van they needn’t wait outside my home any longer.
Camouflage Falls
Welcome to Camouflage Falls, Two Point County’s sweetest little town that doesn’t exist. After years of delays and missed deadlines, the best place for the Two Point government to hide a secret base is in a construction site. Clever, right? This facility was built to cure citizens, from all over the County, suffering from the ‘space illnesses’ that spread as a result of the incident near Goldpan.\n\nWe’re inside the operation now, so we’ll be receiving special tasks to complete whilst we’re treating waves of abducted patients. To be successful, and to help the County against the invasion of alien ailments, we’ll need to complete any special objectives before the end of their respective waves.
Camouflage Falls
Alrighty, I reveal, I am alien too and have been hoaxing you. We liked you all and your strange lands, your harmonising popular music and your cheesy gubbins. But when we bobbed up there were bunches of not so funny health problems. We revolved to convolute a plan to stop diseases whilst keeping our arrival hushy-hushy.\n\nAfter doing cross-examining of your culture, we found you couldn't help the chance to de-sock suspicious wing of government. Anyways, can you imagine if people found us out? That would be super crazy. Would not handle well. No, not at all. No siree. Ah look at me, I’m doing some of your earth blathering ha-ha. Wonderfilled.\n\nThank you for your helpings of our planets and yours. Please stay muffled, although I don’t reckon you’d be too believed! Bye-bye.
Compliments to the chief. Your proficiencies have granted you lots of clearance and an assignment in the towny development of Camouflage Falls. But I have succulent data. This town is not what it seems. No, not a town at all they say. I am really surprised by this surprising news - are you not? They say it is a face for secret government base.\n\nCitizens with space illnesses are being abducted from their kitchen islands, their hammocks and their park walks and taken to Camouflage Falls for their own good. If you’re able to turn around the fight against the space ick, we might receive fully buttered coverage and get to the bottom of this things.
Greetings puny administrator. It is I, investigative journaliser Charlatene Fishwrapper of the Two Point Squabbler. I am conducting secret reporting espionage and have achieved clearance for you to help. The government are hide-and-sneaking a space crash and keeping super quiet, even though there is lots of health problems to the area and its townpeoples.\n\nYou must cure them, and prevent end of times, to receive clearer, more see-through-able clearance for me to write all about government secrecies and find the ongoings going on.
Initiate favour sequence and get a chair to sit with... There is aliens involved in the operations! I have not seized the bottom of the news barrel yet, but learn that aliens arrived on the crashings near Goldpan. If you cooperate one time more, we should see all their doings. You are now a total clearance person and will be taken to deep down headquarters. \r\n\r\nThey say you will need to develop a hiding contraption for the funny looking alien people that don’t look normal like us humans do. They sure do look surprisingly. I for some have not looked at anything like it in my previous looking experiences. Remain carebound and stingy with your trustings.
Transmission over,\nCharlatene Fishwrapper

They’ve faded now, and my mind fills with better, more interesting things.\n\nContinue to melt in the desert for more rewards, or return to the known universe and get back to work.

That’s a point… Perhaps you’ve moved there due to its distinctive inactivity? Ah, the pursuit of a painless position; I know it well. I will be looking into this, partly because it’s my job, partly because the competitor in me refuses to be out-cushied.
Goldpan
Coming Soon!
Camouflage\nFalls
Welcome to Goldpan. The people here live off, and in the shadow of, the “Goldpan Scandal”, when it was reported that aliens had crash-landed near their little town in the south of Two Point County. You’ll notice that a ‘replica’ of the crash site has even been built on the edge of town.\n\nAfter years of being irritated by space-hungry tourists, the townspeople aren’t the friendliest to outsiders, but if you can win them over with some impressive medical accomplishments, I’m sure they’ll let you expand the hospital into other parts of the town. Although they’ll be in disguise and look like regular patients, some of the aliens that landed - yes they really did land - will turn up to the hospital. They’re only curious, but they’ll cut queues, clog up our systems without paying for treatments, and make a mess if we give them the chance. Look out for their cloaking devices failing, as well as suspicious, alien behaviour, so you can send them home.

The numbers suggest that your hospital is really rather good. I wouldn’t know.\n\nContinue to make a mockery of my career for more rewards or return to the known universe and get back to work.
Congratulations. Your hospital has been awarded a 3 Star rating by the Two Point Health Ministry.\n\nNever before have we awarded our highest accolade to an establishment with such little information. I hope that you will excuse me if I don’t see the purpose of receiving a standardised rating for a hospital that, as far as the ministry is concerned, doesn’t exist.
Chasm 24
Welcome to Chasm 24. If you’re reading this, it means that you’ve been given the highest level of security clearance that the County has to offer. This cavern was acquired, years ago, from the mole-people and converted into a top secret research centre by the aliens (that sentence was a lot).\n\nIn this severe environment, deep under the County’s surface, you’ll need to maintain a series of stabilisers to keep the area - you guessed it - stable. They make up an incredibly advanced system, with different stabilisers preventing different problems, that require maintenance by janitors with computer-like brains. Which is exactly what we have: Robo-Janitors. Every type of Robo-Janitor can maintain the stabilisers; however, each model is also programmed in a few, regular janitorial tasks, so make sure to check their qualifications. You’ll receive more Robo-Janitors as you expand the hospital, but each new plot will have a stabiliser that needs maintaining.

Let's Get Herbal
Welcome to Old Newpoint, the original settlement in the current era of Two Point County. Though there is no way to know exactly what happened, a cataclysmic event brought an end to the prior civilisation in Two Point County. It was in Old Newpoint, then just Newpoint, that our foreparents founded life as we know it and began to build sheds, make wicker things, and establish our problems and traditions.\n\nMany of those traditions are practiced in the area to this day, for some reason… Yes, strange traditions such as herbal medicine and horticulture. The residents practice a root-to-stem approach, you won’t find them munching on Cheesy Gubbins, so you’ll need to keep everyone fed and watered by growing your own fruit and vegetables, and collecting rainwater. But the botany doesn’t end there - no! - medicinal Herb Gardens need to be used to treat the region’s most herbaceous afflictions.\nGet gardening.

Congratulations. Your hospital has been awarded a 2 Star rating by the Two Point Health Ministry.\n\nPersonally, that floating pharmacy of yours seems more like a barge than a hospital. I've been scouring the annals of healthcare to see how we can get your status revoked: no luck as of yet. Don't float away.\n\nContinue to leech off of the weather for more rewards, or return from the peninsula and get back to work.
Congratulations. Your hospital has been awarded a 3 Star rating by the Two Point Health Ministry.\n\nIt seems that you are rather ahead of your time, you’ve formulated a blueprint, not simply for the hospital of the future, but the city of the future, too. What a shame that we find ourselves here and now, and not there and then… What’s the phrase, peaked too soon? Shame.

Remember, green energy isn't just for powering rooms, it also influences transport in and out of the city...\n\nAllocating power to the Patient Flow system will increase the rate at which patients arrive at the hospital; while allocating power to the Staff Applicants system will increase the number of potential staff members available to hire.
Green Energy
Welcome to Windsock, the County’s first eco-city and its most expensive thing to be named after, and founded by, the same person. The city has taken over the news, provoking questions like: “How does this work?”, “Why haven’t we done it before?” and “Who paid for this?”. Say what you like about Tabitha, she really wants to get re-elected.\n\nWindsock City doesn’t rely on the usual means of power. Instead, you’ll need to build green energy machines to stay switched-on and self-sufficient. Each of your green energy machines, whether it’s a wind turbine, solar panel or hydro dam, will increase the power capacity of the hospital. The power that you generate can be used to open rooms in your hospital, or allocated to the Patient Flow and Staff Applicants systems, to influence transport in and out of the city.

Keep campers feeling good, deep inside this County Park.
Congratulations. Your hospital has been awarded a 1 Star rating by the Two Point Health Ministry.\n\nSo you’re aiding our Mayor in her attempt to turn the County green… I must say, I’m not terribly comfortable with you making healthcare political. Is nothing sacred anymore? \n\nContinue to campaign for more rewards, or return from the peninsula and get back to work.
Congratulations. Your hospital has been awarded a 2 Star rating by the Two Point Health Ministry.\n\nThe thought of you, recently, sleeping on the floor, eating tin can meals, hosiery sodden, shirt untucked, headwear amiss… Well, I didn't like thinking about it. So I won't. Off to eat an omelette in the bath.\n\nContinue to campaign for more rewards, or return from the peninsula and get back to work.
Congratulations. Your hospital has been awarded a 3 Star rating by the Two Point Health Ministry.\n\nThanks to your makeshift healthcare facility, that inhospitable, hippy housing, hair plaiting, shack-filled, flag waving, pumpkin patching, germ-ridden, soup making, cesspool is slightly less awful. Rejoice.

As a part of the Mayor's green initiative, your hospitals will receive visits from the Department of Green Things and be given Eco Ratings.\n\nEco Ratings may result in bonuses, or fines, from the Mayor, depending on whether you're helping, or hindering, her re-election campaign.
Eco Rating
Welcome to the Wanderoff County Park, where Holistix have been farming rare, natural ingredients for years. Once they heard that the Mayor was planning to trial her green initiative in the area, they decided to open a nature commune, and take advantage of the foot traffic. It's our job to care for the people attached to those feet. Our funding from Holistix will depend on how well we're scoring on their new scale... \n\nYes, the (less than) fine people at Holistix have developed something called a "Wellness Index", which uses a number of different criteria to measure the overall wellbeing of a community. They believe that they've found a correlation between high scores on the Wellness Index and a willingness to purchase their organic tat. We won't receive much for diagnosing and treating patients, so if we want to make money we'll need to score well on the Wellness Index by focusing on its six criteria: staff and patient happiness; attractiveness; hygiene; reputation; and cure rate.
Wanderoff County Park
I’ve done it. I’ve been re-elected as Mayor of Two Point County. I couldn’t have done it without you, so please make sure you feel well and truly responsible.\n\nSadly, the time has come to put an end to our green project. Sometimes we must have the courage to take one step forward, and two steps back. The tide of public opinion has turned, and so too must my focus, to the next hot topic, if I’m to be re-elected again. That’s right, I will not rest until the latest issue on everyone’s mind has been resolved: the education of our County’s dogs.
The success of the community in Wanderoff has kicked things off perfectly for the Department of Green Things. It’s shown the potential of the County when people are brought together with a common goal in mind: voting for me.\n\nNext on the campaign trail, you’ll be heading to Old Newpoint. There are lots of new, enthusiastic residents getting involved in traditional, green activities like gardening and… others. I’m told that they like the history of the place so much, that they’re knocking down old buildings and replacing them with buildings that look even older. It’s great to see people getting into the spirit of my campaign.
So sorry that I wasn’t able to make it - again - but as long as you’re there I know that Team Windsock is well represented. That being said… Our stay in Old Newpoint has been another rousing success for the Department of Green Things. Now, to steal the deal with the final stop on the campaign trail. You’re going to like this. It’s time to cut the ribbon on our County’s first eco-city, my gift to the people of this county: Windsock City!\n\nWell, if the people won’t build you a city, use their money to build one yourself. Only joking, of course. I mean, that is what I’ve done, but I don’t mean it like that, you know? People can’t take a joke… or the truth. People hate the truth. What am I saying. Bla-bla-bla. Anyway, good luck!
Vote,\nTabitha Windsock
Here forever,\nTabitha Windsock
It’s that time again. Our County is approaching another mayoral election, and I’ve decided that beginning our journey towards a greener tomorrow is long overdue. Our voter research suggests that it’s the issue on everyone's mind, and I am willing to fall on the sword of extensive positive press by founding the Department of Green Things.\n\nWhen people remember Tabitha Windsock, I want them to remember my green initiative and how I got re-elected that time. Please, support the initiative by taking care of our green-minded, recently-pro-windsock, community. I need them in this time of need, uncertainty and poor voter polling, because, frankly, the dead can’t vote.

Congratulations. Your hospital has been awarded a 1 Star rating by the Two Point Health Ministry. Like lightning, you have made a mockery of your detractors by striking a second time…\n\nYou are commended on your endeavours into the inner workings of machines and the human mind, respectively. Now, focus on your budding two-headed empire, or add a third head, by opening a new hospital in Flottering, as it’s currently not much of an empire.
Congratulations. Your hospital has been awarded a 2 Star rating by the Two Point Health Ministry.\n\nYour organisation’s lifespan continues to eclipse even the most daring predictions from our office-wide wager. As you grow larger, and procure new plates that require spinning, the inevitable crash draws nearer and nearer. Best not to think about it.
Congratulations. Your hospital has been awarded a 3 Star rating by the Two Point Health Ministry.\n\nBeing recognised as a first-class establishment is always an accomplishment to be celebrated. May your festivities be righteous, but brief, then get back to work.

<style="AdvisorHighlight">Pharmacy Drug Mixer II Upgrade</style> unlocked!\\n<style="AdvisorHighlight">General Diagnosis EZ-Scan II Upgrade</style> unlocked!
Bungle Technologies have given us access to some of their latest technology: a Pharmacy Drug Mixer upgrade, and a General Diagnosis EZ-Scan machine upgrade. If we buy these for our machines, they will become more powerful, helping us diagnose and cure more patients.\\n\\nTo upgrade a machine, we'll need a Janitor with a Mechanics Qualification. Select the machine and choose the upgrade option. A qualified Janitor will then upgrade the machine over time.\\n\\nGive it a try and Bungle might have some more tech for us...
New Technology
<style="AdvisorHighlight">Pans Lab</style> room unlocked!
Great, the machine upgrade is complete! Make sure we've got a few fire extinguishers dotted around to keep our precious machine safe.\\n\\nBungle Technologies are grateful for our continued support with their psychiatry patients, and have given us access to one of their machines: the Extract-a-Pan. This high tech gadget is great for removal of unwanted kitchen utensils. Look out for people in need of this!\\n\\nContinue expanding the hospital to unlock some more technology. Buying another plot of land nearby will give us more space to develop the hospital.
New Technology
Let's build up the hospital a bit while we deal with some of the psychiatry patients from Bungle...
We've been contacted by Bungle Technologies, who run various research hospitals across the county. They have an interesting proposition for us. Their psychiatry licence was recently revoked due to an incident with... well it's best not to go into it. They want to send us psychiatry patients, and in exchange will allow us to buy some of their latest technology.\\n\\nUntil our organisation acquires a research licence, we need all the technology we can get our hands on.
New Technology
Upgrade a machine to make it more powerful. Click on a machine in the <style="AdvisorHighlight">Pharmacy</style> or <style="AdvisorHighlight">General Diagnosis</style>, then select the upgrade option.
We can construct new hospital buildings by purchasing plots of land nearby. Take a look around the hospital grounds - hover over nearby plots to see the size and shape of the plot, and the price.\n\nTo buy a plot, click on it and choose the purchase option. A new building will then be constructed over time.\n\nOnce the new building is complete, we can use the extra space to expand the hospital. We can also move existing rooms between plots if we want to rearrange things.
Constructing New Buildings
Welcome to Lower Bullocks. It's a lovely little village with a big problem. A significant proportion of the population believe themselves to be rock stars. There's only one thing that can cure this... Psychiatry.\\n\\nOnly Doctors with a Psychiatry Qualification will be able to diagnose and treat people in a Psychiatry room. We've managed to find one, but you should keep your eyes peeled for job applicants with Psychiatry and other useful qualifications.
Staff Qualifications
Machines can be upgraded to make them more effective. An upgraded diagnosis machine gives a bigger boost to a patient's diagnosis. An upgraded treatment machine is more likely to successfully cure patients.\n\nUpgrades for each machine can be acquired by completing challenges, and eventually through our own research too.\n\nOnce we have unlocked an upgrade, we'll need a Janitor trained in Mechanics to upgrade each machine. To upgrade a machine, select it and choose the upgrade option. A qualified Janitor will carry out the required work over time.

<style="AdvisorHighlight">Clown Clinic</style> unlocked!
Flottering has had a bit of a problem recently... clowns. They're everywhere! Apparently they keep escaping from the travelling circus. Their high jinks can be a real nuisance. We'll need some new equipment to deal with them.\\n\\nThe Orb Foundation have a patented method for recalibrating the minds of clowns, supporting their rehabilitation back into society. They have offered to supply us with the necessary equipment if we can demonstrate our ability to 'mould' our own staff. Sounds a bit sinister to me, but who am I to judge?
Beware... Clowns!
Learn about staff development and training.
Congratulations. Your hospital has been awarded a 1 Star rating by the Two Point Health Ministry.\n\nYou’re getting rather good at this, I see, and showing signs of an ability to develop staff from within. How terribly promising. Which is to say: how terrible.\n\nStay there to nurture this fledgling talent, or abandon it altogether and move on to pastures new in our chilly Northern region.
Congratulations. Your hospital has been awarded a 2 Star rating by the Two Point Health Ministry.\n\nGreater success gives birth to greater expectations. Everyone wants their supposedly 'fair share'. I'm curious to see how you cope as hungry employees begin to eat away at you like sock-wearing parasites from within. Best wishes to the whole gang down at Flottering.
Congratulations. Your hospital has been awarded a 3 Star rating by the Two Point Health Ministry.\n\nOn this venture, you have demonstrated an ability to eke potential out of others, like much needed blood from so many stones, a miracle that you will need to duplicate, if you're ever to do this again.
Flottering
To get the most out of our staff, we'll need to train and promote them. When someone has gained enough experience on the job, and had some training, they will be ready for promotion. By promoting them, their skills increase and they are able to learn a new qualification. They might also want a pay rise.\\n\\nFirstly though, we'll need a training licence. The Two Point Health Ministry has promised to grant us a licence if we can demonstrate our commitment to staff wellbeing here in Flottering.
Staff Development
<style="AdvisorHighlight">Training Room</style> unlocked!
Great news, the Two Point Health Ministry has granted us a training licence! This will allow us to train staff in all of our hospitals.\\n\\nBuilding a Training Room allows you to run a training course. Staff with a free training slot can go on a course to learn a new qualification.
Training Licence
To start a training course, click on the lectern, or drop a suitable member of staff into the room. Staff will also request training when they're ready.\\n\\nIn the training screen, select the qualification you want staff to learn, assign a trainer, and select the staff you wish to send on this course. When you're ready, click the start button.\\n\\nWhen picking a trainer, you can use your own staff, choosing one of their qualifications to teach. Or you can pay extra to bring in a guest trainer.

Congratulations. Your hospital has been awarded a 1 Star rating - that’s one out of a possible three - by the Two Point Health Ministry. I have retrieved your file from my bin to celebrate.\n\nContinue to develop your enterprise in Hogsport, for further esteem and trinkets, if you believe that you’re capable of more. Alternatively, run before you can walk and begin to expand your organisation by opening a new hospital in Lower Bullocks.\nThe choice, as they say, is yours.
Congratulations. Your hospital has been awarded a 2 Star rating by the Two Point Health Ministry.\n\nIf you proceed at your current pace, you will have achieved everything that you can in your founding establishment soon enough. I can sense your confidence inflating: careful that you don’t build yourself up for an even greater fall…
Congratulations. Your hospital has been awarded a 3 Star rating by the Two Point Health Ministry.\n\nI hope, for your sake, that you remember how you were able to concoct such a model institution, because the County will expect you to repeat this feat ‘ad infinitum’. May this free you of gumption and fill you with nerves.

Great. Before we officially open, we'll need a GP's Office. Patients will visit a GP at each stage of diagnosis.\\n\\nLet's build a GP's Office now...
GP's Office
Great. Before we officially open, we'll need a GP's Office.\n\nPatients will visit a Doctor working as a General Practitioner at each stage of diagnosis. The GP will assess patients and decide if they are ready for treatment, or if they require further diagnosis.\n\nLet's build a GP's Office now...
General Practitioner's Office
Click on <style="AdvisorHighlight">Rooms</style>, then <style="AdvisorHighlight">GP's Office</style>. Drag out a floorplan (minimum size <style="AdvisorHighlight">3 x 3</style>). Place a Door, Office Desk and Filing Cabinet. Then click the <style="AdvisorHighlight">green tick</style>.
To build a room, click on the Rooms button and pick one from the list.\\n\\nWith a room selected, drag out a floorplan of the appropriate size.\\n\\nThen place the required items in the room.
Room Building
Staff will head to a Staff Room when they're on a break. Fill the room with interesting items to help them become fully refreshed before their break ends.\\n\\nNote: You can place a member of staff in a Staff Room to make them take a break, or in a work room to make them work there. To pick up a member of staff, hover over them and hold the Left Mouse Button.
Staff Room
Wards can be used for diagnosis, and also to treat a range of illnesses. A nurse is required to admit each patient, look after them, and discharge them when they're ready to leave.\\n\\nAdd multiple beds to a Ward to deal with more than one patient at a time. You can also adjust the number of nurses that should work there in the room settings - this is useful if you have lots of patients.
Wards
We've exhausted all forms of diagnosis on a patient, and we still don't know how to treat them. We'll need some more diagnosis rooms, otherwise the patient will leave.
Oh dear. One of our machines exploded. We'll need to clear up the debris, get rid of the wreckage and buy a new machine. Let's make sure we have enough Fire Extinguishers and Janitors too.
Explosion!
Slight problem... One of our machines is on fire due to poor maintenance! A Janitor will look for a Fire Extinguisher and attempt to put out the fire before it's too late. Make sure there are enough Fire Extinguishers nearby.
Fire!
Sad news, our first patient death. Patients can die if a treatment fails, or if they are waiting too long and their health deteriorates. The hospital reputation will suffer as a result.\\n\\nThere's also a chance the patient will return to haunt the hospital! If this happens, we'll need a Janitor with a Ghost Capture qualification.
Patient Death
Now we have everything we need to diagnose and cure a simple illness. Let's see if our new staff are up to the task!
Well done, we've cured our first patient! We've earned some money, and the hospital's reputation has improved, which will attract more patients.\\n\\nWhen a doctor or nurse treats a patient, their ability will influence the chance of success. Some illnesses are tougher than others.\\n\\nContinue diagnosing and treating patients to keep the money coming in, so we can expand the hospital.
Patient Cured!
By curing patients, we improve the <style="AdvisorHighlight">Hospital Reputation</style>. This will attract more patients, allowing us to bring in more money!
Let's keep an eye on our first patient as they head for diagnosis with the GP...
<style="AdvisorHighlight">General Diagnosis</style> unlocked!
We're hearing reports of some new illnesses in town. These might be harder to diagnose.\\n\\nWe may need to build a new diagnosis room. If a GP isn't certain, they will send a patient for further diagnosis.
Further Diagnosis
Oh dear, a patient appears to have returned from the dead. We'll need a Janitor with a Ghost Capture Qualification!
When a patient dies, sometimes a part of them remains. The most terrifying part, sadly. This can be quite upsetting for those of us still clinging on to life. Not only that, but ghosts are messy blighters, leaving a trail of ectoplasm. They also have a habit of dematerialising and popping up elsewhere.\\n\\nWho should we call? A Janitor with a Ghost Capture Qualification, of course. They are fully trained with the latest autopsychic ghost-suction technology. In future we might even be able to harvest spiritual matter for use by our research team.

As you expand the hospital with more rooms and staff, the Hospital Level increases. A larger hospital attracts more patients.\\n\\nAs the hospital gets busier, queues may start to get long. We may need to build more GP's Offices and other rooms, and hire more staff, to deal with the extra patients.\\n\\nLook out for queue warnings above rooms. You can also hover over a room to highlight people queueing for that room.

Good news, our hospital is now open for business! Patients are starting to arrive. After they register at Reception they'll be sent to the GP for diagnosis.

The Two Point Health Ministry is keen to recognise the achievements of every hospital in the county. If we can build a hospital that satisfies the needs of the local area, the hospital will be awarded an official Star rating.\n\nThis will be great for our organisation. Not only does each star come with associated rewards, but it will also allow us to establish new hospitals around the county.\n\nContinue to expand the hospital to acquire a 1 Star rating...

Janitors will empty bins and unblock toilets when required. This is much better than having to sweep up litter and, erm, other waste.
Drinks and snacks are great for keeping people happy, but they can lead to littering if there are no bins nearby. While we're at it, staff and patients will get pretty grumpy if they don't have access to any toilets. You might want to invest in some quality porcelain.\\n\\nJanitors will help maintain all of these: restocking vending machines, sweeping up litter, emptying bins, and unblocking toilets.
Charlie Work
Now that we've got some expensive machinery, we should think about looking after it. Machines will deteriorate with use, and will need repairing from time to time. If a machine falls into disrepair it can be a fire hazard. Fires are generally considered, erm, bad for business.\\n\\nHire a Janitor to maintain machines. While you're at it, make sure we've got some Fire Extinguishers nearby. Better safe than sorry, right?

Congratulations. Your hospital has been awarded a 1 Star rating by the Two Point Health Ministry.\n\nYou’re doing a smashing job of gluing back together all of those witless activity-bandits. I’ve never seen the appeal of pursuits ‘al fresco’, myself.

Tumble
Welcome to Tumble. This small town attracts tourists from across the county to climb Tumble Ridge and hike along the Tumble Downs. Lucky for us, this generates hundreds of fractured bones each year. Cha-ching!\n\nWe'll need to build a Fracture Ward to deal with these injuries. I recommend building a standard Ward and other essentials too. Make sure to keep everyone warm with some radiators.\n\nTumble has been known to experience seismic activity, so look out for earthquake warnings. We'll need Janitors ready to deal with any damage.

Deal with a range of injuries in this town at the base of the mountain. Oh and try to stop people from freezing too.
Underlook
Welcome to Underlook. This small town at the base of the mountain is home to the Underlook Ski Resort. It's a wonderful tourist attraction, and, lucky for us, generates hundreds of fractured bones each year. Cha-ching!\\n\\nTemperatures are extremely low here. You'll need to splash out on lots of radiators.

In the research screen, you can select a project from the available projects list.\\n\\nOnce a project has been started, you'll need a Doctor with a Research Qualification to carry out the work. They will contribute research to the project over time, based on their research skill.\\n\\nResearch is shared across the whole organisation, as are the discoveries we make. You can start a project in one hospital and then continue work on it in another hospital.
Research
Home to some of the brightest minds in Two Point County. It may be chilly, but it's also the perfect place for us to start developing some new technology: Mitton University Research & Teaching Hospital.
Well done, we've completed a research project! This discovery can be used across the whole organisation.\\n\\nWhen a project is completed, researchers will look for work elsewhere, unless we kick off another project. As we make new discoveries, and travel to new parts of the county, our boffins will propose new areas for research. Keep your eyes peeled for new projects!
Research Project Complete!
Congratulations. Your hospital has been awarded a 1 Star rating by the Two Point Health Ministry.\n\nIt bodes well that your organisation has begun to dabble in research. Our initial notes suggested, wrongly it seems, that you weren’t well suited to this particular task. Rest assured that whoever was responsible for such an off-the-mark-remark will be losing their job forthwith. Unless it was me, of course… perish the thought.\n\nContinue with your studies for more rewards, or go elsewhere and expand your organisation.
Congratulations. Your hospital has been awarded a 2 Star rating by the Two Point Health Ministry.\n\nI hear that your research and development has been taking further strides: bully for you.\n\nContinue with your studies for more rewards, or go elsewhere and expand your organisation.
Congratulations. Your hospital has been awarded a 3 Star rating by the Two Point Health Ministry.\n\nYou have established a first-class research institute and a terrific boon to the university. I’m told that they’re very grateful and I’d imagine that I’m supposed to be too. Alas.
Mitton University
Good news! Mitton University have awarded us <style="AdvisorHighlight">{[REWARDS]}</style> for the completion of some research.
Great news, the Two Point Health Ministry has granted us a research licence! This will allow any of our hospitals to research new machines, upgrades and more.\\n\\nTo kick off a research project we'll need a Research Room and a Doctor with a Research Qualification.\\n\\nDiagnosis and treatment of patients can also contribute to research progress. Harvesting ghosts can also be very... enlightening.
Research Licence
Good news! Mitton University have awarded us <style="AdvisorHighlight">{[REWARDS]}</style> for the completion of some training.
The vice-chancellor of Mitton University has been impressed with our progress, and we've been invited to establish Mitton University Research & Teaching Hospital. This is a great opportunity for us, we can set up a research department and develop some new tech!\n\nWe'll only be able to recruit student doctors and nurses here, so we'll need to train them up. Mitton University will provide us with extra funds for each person we train, and each research project we complete.\n\nFirstly though, we'll need a research licence. The ministry will grant us one if we can demonstrate our technical prowess by establishing a hospital with some upgraded machinery.

A hospital in the wealthy town of Flemington.
Congratulations. Your hospital has been awarded a 1 Star rating by the Two Point Health Ministry.\n\nA fine town is deserving of a fine hospital, don’t you think? Of course you do: that’s precisely what you’ve begun developing. Top drawer. Your efforts in the world of marketing have not gone unnoticed. May your corporate siren-song bring forth a bounty of cash-rich sickos.\n\nIf you grow tired of making us money, I suggest that you venture Eastward into the County’s most toilet-y region.
Congratulations. Your hospital has been awarded a 2 Star rating by the Two Point Health Ministry.\n\nThe Foxbridge homestead resides in the greater-Flemington area, as do much of the Foxbridge clan. It has been a delight to hear so many positive things about your establishment from them all. There’s nothing like news straight from the horse’s mouth, or the mouth of horse owners - rather!\n\nContinue building the hospital that Flemington deserves for more rewards, or go elsewhere and expand your organisation.
Congratulations. Your hospital has been awarded a 3 Star rating by the Two Point Health Ministry.\n\nFlemingtonians are a sophisticated breed, so it reflects well on you and your organisation that your hospital lives up to their lofty standards and fits into our most noble of towns. I hope you’re able to spread civility as well as you’re able to stop the spreading of germs.
Great news, the Two Point Health Ministry has granted us a marketing licence! This will allow us to run marketing campaigns to improve our reputation, and attract more patients and staff to the hospital.\\n\\nBuild a Marketing Room and hire (or train) an Assistant with a Marketing Qualification to run the campaigns.
Marketing Licence
Flemington
Welcome to Flemington, a wealthy town where the people have more money than sense. I think we could make a killing here (pardon the expression) if we can get ourselves a marketing licence.\\n\\nWe can use marketing campaigns to improve our reputation, attract more patients and recruit better staff.\\n\\nI suggest we focus our research, and marketing, on an illness that has been plaguing the area for a while: Animal Magnetism.

An abandoned hospital near the power plant.
Congratulations. Your hospital has been awarded a 1 Star rating by the Two Point Health Ministry.\n\nIn truth, we feared that nothing could survive in the grounds that you currently occupy, so to hear that you’re not just alive, but managing to treat people is, certainly, gravy on the proverbial goose.\n\nContinue to play with fire for more rewards, or flee that unstable place and expand your organisation.
Congratulations. Your hospital has been awarded a 2 Star rating by the Two Point Health Ministry.\n\nAs I hear word of your Franken-hospital expanding, I ask that you do try to keep it under control. In addition, you may want to periodically check the firmness of the ground, as there have been, shall we say, resistance based issues in the past… Fare thee well.\n\nContinue to play with fire for more rewards, or flee that unstable place and expand your organisation.
Congratulations. Your hospital has been awarded a 3 Star rating by the Two Point Health Ministry.\n\nYou have pacified a total monstrosity, taming its unbridled power and channelling it to serve your purpose… so, splendid job with that. I should add that you are much better tenants than those ghastly Blungle people.
Melt Downs
The Melt Downs Power Plant seems to be experiencing some 'technical difficulties'. Bungle Technologies, owners of the power plant, have put out a press release saying everything is fine, no need to panic. The very same day they also evacuated this nearby hospital. Apparently an experiment in their research department went awry. Mayor Windsock has asked if we could take over. We found some intriguing research papers scattered around, maybe we should continue their work?\\n\\nLooks like the place needs a bit of a tidy up first. Also, rumour has it there are some very strange patients showing up in the local area. Erm, good luck!
Melt Downs Hospital
Assist the Two Point Health Service with a public hospital.
I’m required to inform you that the Two Point Health Ministry has awarded your hospital a 1 Star rating.\n\nWe have launched an investigation into how this was possible, but do keep up the good, albeit suspicious, work.\n\nQuit whilst you’re ahead and move on to the County’s tropical South, or stay there, of all places, if you really are, indeed, that stupid.
I’m required to inform you that the Two Point Health Ministry has awarded your hospital a 2 Star rating.\n\nSurely you’ve proven yourself in the sector and should take your talents onto a new, and more deserving, challenge.
3 Star status.\n\nFelicitations. \n\nGo do something else.
Duckworth-upon-Bilge
Health Minister Tarquin Foxbridge has requested our assistance. The county's public health system, the TPHS, is struggling to cope. Duckworth Hospital, one of the few remaining public hospitals, has lost its administrator. Lord Foxbridge has proposed that we help run this public hospital. Could be good for us. Nudge nudge, wink wink.\\n\\nIf we can meet the Ministry’s targets we'll receive some of the County’s healthcare budget, but we won't receive income for any diagnosis, treatment or retail. This could be interesting...
Duckworth-upon-Bilge
A teaching hospital focused on surgery.
Congratulations. The Two Point Health Ministry has awarded your hospital a 1 Star rating. \n\nAh Smogley. I always forget about dear old Smogley. I do not thank you for reminding me of its existence. My compliments on the development of your surgical practices, although it is rather base as far as practices go. If you’re going to insist on rummaging around inside of people do remember to wash your hands. \n\nContinue tinkering with innards for more rewards, or go elsewhere and expand your organisation.
Congratulations. Your hospital has been awarded a 2 Star rating by the Two Point Health Ministry.\n\nThe development of your hospital continues to be the most significant thing to happen to Smogley since that cloud momentarily parted and its people were first introduced to the sun. I’d imagine they’re planning a primitive statue, made of mud and twigs, in your likeness.\n\nContinue tinkering with innards for more rewards, or go elsewhere and expand your organisation.
Congratulations. Your hospital has been awarded a 3 Star rating by the Two Point Health Ministry.\n\nSmogley, as we know, is a dire place, in dire need of a feature to alert the cartographers to its existence. Your excellent hospital may well be that feature. People would come from miles around to see it, if anyone could see through that opaque guff Smogley has in place of air.
Smogley
Welcome to Smogley. Based just outside the city, the mayor is keen to help develop this area. Currently this means it receives a generous supply of two things: pollution, and patients requiring surgery.\\n\\nI'd recommend building up a teaching hospital and training some surgeons. Surgery requires a qualified doctor, and a nurse, but it brings in the big bucks so it's worth it.
Smogley Hospital
The Sweaty Palms resort is a delightful holiday destination, if you don't mind the frequent earthquakes and other natural disasters.
Congratulations. Your hospital has been awarded a 1 Star rating by the Two Point Health Ministry.\n\nI remember being forced to visit the beaches of Sweaty Palms as a child. There was something about that incessant sun and the threat of molten lava that played on my nerves. I’m pleased to see that you seem to be faring much better, with the heat and the threat of natural disasters, than the young Foxbridge.\n\nContinue to perspire for more rewards, or go elsewhere and expand your organisation.
Congratulations. Your hospital has been awarded a 2 Star rating by the Two Point Health Ministry.\n\nIt is clear that the allure of the so-called ‘beach life’ has been outmatched by your devotion to your post. I applaud this rousing display of priorities.\n\nContinue to perspire for more rewards, or go elsewhere and expand your organisation.
Congratulations. Your hospital has been awarded a 3 Star rating by the Two Point Health Ministry.\n\nIt is positively heart-warming to learn that the environment is no match for ruthless administration. I’m sure that you are swiftly becoming the hero of bureaucrats everywhere.
Sweaty Palms
Welcome to Sweaty Palms Resort, a beautiful holiday destination. Sadly, it's also plagued by earthquakes, volcanic activity, and other natural disasters. Also some unnatural disasters, thanks to The Orb Foundation if the conspiracy theorists are to be believed.\\n\\nI recommend hiring a few Janitors to keep machines repaired and clear up any debris. Explosions can be a bit upsetting, in my experience. Oh and some air-conditioning would be nice, it's boiling around here.
Sweaty Palms Hospital
This town is riddled with contagious diseases. But otherwise lovely.
Congratulations. The Two Point Health Ministry has awarded your hospital a 1 Star rating.\n\nYes, germs may be rather small, but it is no small feat to contain a peril so multitudinous, and we know of nowhere that contains them in such an abundance than Blighton. This is an important battle won in the fight against very tiny things.\n\nContinue the fight, or venture into the city at the heart of the County. The metropolis beckons, are you prepared to answer its call? You know, I think I might be somewhat invested: how very disturbing.
Congratulations. Your hospital has been awarded a 2 Star rating by the Two Point Health Ministry.\n\nIt has been a refreshing change to receive reports from Blighton that we don’t have to destroy for legal reasons, I thank you for that.\n\nContinue your fight against the microscopic for more rewards, or go elsewhere and expand your organisation.
Congratulations. Your hospital has been awarded a 3 Star rating by the Two Point Health Ministry.\n\nIt’s remarkable, and we’re still cross-checking, but some of our data suggests that your hospital may have actually made Blighton a nice place. This is tremendous, if not unsettling, news.
Blighton
Welcome to Blighton. It's hot, it's sticky, and it's plagued by all sorts of contagious diseases.\\n\\nKeep an eye on hygiene levels, and vaccines at the ready!
Blighton Hospital
Tourists like to bring all manner of peculiar illnesses to this wonderful sunny town.
Congratulations. Your hospital has been awarded a 1 Star rating by the Two Point Health Ministry.\n\nTourism is, undoubtedly, a disease of sorts, but it’s also vital for the livelihood of the County. For tourism to thrive, the tourists themselves must survive. Now that this is happening, they can return home to tell their friends… and their friends’ money.\n\nContinue working in hospitality for more rewards, or go elsewhere and expand your organisation.
Congratulations. Your hospital has been awarded a 2 Star rating by the Two Point Health Ministry.\n\nYou continue to successfully monitor the portal through which most illnesses enter the county. The people they reside within are people of leisure and do like a spectacle, so remember to put on a show.\n\nContinue working in hospitality for more rewards, or go elsewhere and expand your organisation.\n
Congratulations. Your hospital has been awarded a 3 Star rating by the Two Point Health Ministry.\n\nNever has our County’s premier tourist destination been so fittingly medically supported, our visitors are, by and large, healthy, happy and spending lots of money. Your hospital has even become quite the hotspot, itself. Bravo.
Grockle Bay
Welcome to Grockle Bay. It's a tourist hotspot. Prepare to be inundated with germ-ridden holiday makers who can't cope with the heat in the south.\\n\\nI recommend investing in some air-conditioning at the earliest opportunity.

Take over this failing inner city hospital and turn it around.
Congratulations. Your hospital has been awarded a 1 Star rating by the Two Point Health Ministry.\n\nLong has the debt of this hospital been weighing on my mind. I’m sorry to say that at one point it almost affected my rest. I came very close to shutting it down, but now that you’ve steadied the ship I don’t have to do all that paperwork. Here’s to you, maestro.\n\nContinue this restoration project for more rewards, or leave that ragtag neighbourhood and expand your organisation.
Congratulations. Your hospital has been awarded a 2 Star rating by the Two Point Health Ministry.\n\nPreviously, when asked about the state of the Rotting Hill hospital by my superiors, I would save their worries, and my job, and say that everything was going swimmingly. You have done us all a great favour by allowing me to speak to them with newfound and unprecedented veracity.\n\nContinue this restoration project for more rewards, or leave that ragtag neighbourhood and expand your organisation.
Congratulations. Your hospital has been awarded a 3 Star rating by the Two Point Health Ministry.\n\nWho would have thought, when you took over this hospital, that we were in store for such archetypal rags-to-riches tale. Now that I’ve put it in those terms, I find it quite sickening.
Rotting Hill
Rotting Hill Hospital has been on its last legs for a while, thanks in part to the ruthless business practices of Jumbo Healthcare. It's out of cash, reputation is poor, and it smells faintly of cabbage. Mayor Windsock and the Health Ministry have made the tough decision to transfer ownership from the Two Point Health Service over to our organisation.\\n\\nWe'll need a loan if we want to turn this place around!
Rotting Hill Hospital
Build a hospital in the busiest part of the city centre. Prepare for an onslaught. Good luck!
Congratulations. Your hospital has been awarded a 1 Star rating by the Two Point Health Ministry.\n\nYour organisation has become the gold standard for healthcare in Two Point County. You’ve risen above all competition, leaving their long-held hopes and dreams lying, soiled, in a shabby tatters, on the ground. A soothing thought, is it not?\n\nContinue aiding the County’s most hectic area to cement your legacy.
Congratulations. Your hospital has been awarded a 2 Star rating by the Two Point Health Ministry.\n\nI’m sure we’re in agreeance that my sterling leadership is to thank for you overcoming some of your more questionable qualities. But where exactly is my acclaim, my long-overdue notoriety, my fancy letter?\nI implore you to reflect on this injustice in place of any pencilled-in jubilatory shenanigans.\n\nContinue aiding the County’s most hectic area to cement your legacy.
Congratulations. Your hospital has been awarded a 3 Star rating by the Two Point Health Ministry.\n\nThe news media have begun to deliberate concernedly about “overpopulation”, surely there is no greater compliment to a hospital administrator.\n\nYour name shall reverberate through the halls of the Ministry for generations, interrupting our all-too-brief silences and reminding us of the County’s true potential. Maybe at some point I’ll commit it to memory…
Croquembouche
Welcome to the heart of the city. This is it, our toughest challenge yet. Thousands of people flood through Croquembouche every day. At least half of them are sick, in my opinion. The tower of Jumbo Mega Corporation looms in the distance. Jumbo Healthcare have dominated for too long. If we can build a successful hospital here, we will cement our position as one of the top organisations in the county.
Croquembouche Hospital
Build a high tech hospital to help cure the many illnesses plaguing the city.
Congratulations. Your hospital has been awarded a 1 Star rating by the Two Point Health Ministry.\n\nI may not understand all of your newfangled gadgetry, but I am pleased to hear that you’re putting it to good use.\n\nContinue modernising the County for more rewards, or go elsewhere and expand your organisation.
Congratulations. Your hospital has been awarded a 2 Star rating by the Two Point Health Ministry.\n\nAlthough I’m delighted to hear that you’re propelling our County’s healthcare into the future, as it were, I ask that you do be wary of your mechanical associates, lest we unwittingly bring about the end of times. Anyway, smashing job.\n\nContinue modernising the County for more rewards, or go elsewhere and expand your organisation.
Congratulations. Your hospital has been awarded a 3 Star rating by the Two Point Health Ministry.\n\nI’m told that the future depends upon increased automation, and, whilst I might contend the point behind closed doors, I’m well aware that it’s in my best political interest to support this ill-conceived cause publically. I refuse to seem out of touch, you see, besides… no one likes a moth in the marmalade.
Pelican Wharf
Welcome to Pelican Wharf. This high-tech hub is bustling with activity, and plagued by some tricky ailments. It's a great place to set up a new hospital, but we'll need some powerful machinery if we want to flourish here.\\n\\nI recommend focusing on research, and upgrading our machines as much as possible.
Pelican Wharf Hospital
I would like to invite you to use R.E.M.I. X, or Rendered Environments of Medical Intrigue... X, a software that simulates hospital management (if you can imagine such a thing). It'll be used to train the County's administrators of the future in a safe setting where people aren't actually dying, but it's not ready just yet. The software needs to analyse existing hospitals to model its hypothetical healthcare scenarios. Those scenarios will need testing, too, preferably by someone who knows what they're doing.\n\nIf it wasn't clear, please test out the software. That'd be swell... Thanks!

The choice is yours.\n\nSelect a map, name your hospital, and choose how much cash and Kudosh you want to start with. Decide whether you want to unlock rooms, items and upgrades with research and Kudosh, or have them all available from the start.

Choose what types of illnesses you want to face, set the pace of patient arrivals, and adjust other settings for the level.\n\nWhen you're ready, click the Start button to open your new hospital. You can browse all of your sandbox hospitals in the My Hospitals tab, and continue to adjust the settings for each one.

Use the staff list, patient list and illness list to monitor and manage the people in your hospital. Quickly find staff and patients and then jump to them in the hospital.
Staff, Patients & Illnesses
View the world with state-of-the-art Hospital Administrator Goggles. Designed by Bungle Technologies, these high-tech spectacles use advanced optical sensors and a patented 'Privacy Invasion' algorithm to analyse the state of people and items within the field of view. Through careful calibration, scientists have been able to harness the powers of this extraordinary invention to detect such things as: how much someone needs the toilet, or how much they want a packet of crisps. Inspiring stuff.\n\nUse these visualisation modes to analyse the state of the hospital environment, the moods and needs of patients and staff, and the maintenance levels of items in the hospital.
Visualisation Modes
In the finance tab you can access the business overview screen for a deep dive on all aspects of the hospital. You can also adjust the prices you charge in this hospital, and take out a loan if you need more cash.
Finance
Use the illnesses list to review which illnesses have been encountered in this hospital so far.\n\nView cure rates and statistics for each illness based on the patients that have visited the hospital. Also see your reputation for dealing with each illness, which feeds into the hospital's overall medical reputation. A higher reputation with an illness will attract more patients exhibiting the symptoms of that illness.
Illnesses List
Here you can view loan offers from a range of companies, take out loans and repay existing loans. Each loan company offers a different amount of money, with a monthly repayment based on the repayment period and interest rate. Some loan offers will only become available once the hospital meets certain criteria.\n\nYou can adjust the amount you want to borrow before taking out the loan, using the slider. Once you have taken out a loan, you can repay it at any time as long as you have enough money.
Loans
In the business overview screen you can review the hospital finances, staff overview, patient overview, and hospital event log. You can also view leaderboards comparing your hospital to those owned by other organisations, and see the awards the hospital has won in previous years.\n\nAt the end of each year, the Hospital Awards Ceremony takes place, after which you are invited to the yearly business review.
Overview Screen
Use the patient list to monitor all of the patients in the hospital, review their diagnosis and treatment progress, and health and happiness. Quickly find people who are unhappy or unhealthy and fast-track them by bumping them up the queue for their appointment.\n\nClick on a patient in the list to jump to that person in the hospital. Click on the arrows by each column heading to sort the list based on that column.
Patients List
Adjust the prices you charge for diagnosis, treatment, and other things in the hospital. On establishing a new hospital, the prices default to the market rate for that location - visitors will be willing to pay these prices.\n\nIncreasing prices will bring in more money but can damage your reputation and cause patients to storm out. Decreasing prices will bring in less money but can help boost your reputation.
Prices List
See which staff members are qualified to carry out each type of job in the hospital, and control who is allowed to do each job. For example, if you only want your best staff working in a GP's Office, you can disable that job for junior staff.\n\nBy default, each staff member is allowed to do every job, as long as they are qualified for it. Use the buttons to enable and disable each job for each person.
Staff Job Assignment
Review the salaries of your staff, and see how satisfied they are with their pay. As staff are promoted and trained, they will expect a higher salary. Their pay satisfaction will affect their overall happiness.\n\nThe face next to each person's salary indicates their pay satisfaction level. To give someone a pay rise, adjust the slider below their salary and then click the confirm button. To quickly give pay rises to all people who feel underpaid, use the 'Satisfy Pay Requests' button.
Staff Pay Review
Use the staff list to quickly find people based on their job, ability and qualifications. See what each person is currently doing, and keep an eye on their happiness and energy.\n\nClick on someone in the list to jump to that person in the hospital. Use the job filters to view each staff type separately. Click on the arrows by each column heading to sort the list based on that column.\n\nUse the Pay Review button to review salaries and pay satisfaction for each staff member. Use the Job Assignment button to control which jobs each person is allowed to do.
Staff List
Compete with other healthcare organisations in a range of timed challenges. Earn extra rewards, and bragging rights, by triumphing over your rivals. Take on rival organisations from Two Point County, or challenge hospitals owned by your online friends.\r\n\nEach challenge takes place over a number of months. You can compete at the same time as your rivals, or at separate times, and your results are recorded by the Two Point Competition Committee. You'll receive updates throughout the challenge on how each participant was doing at that stage of the competition.
Organisation Challenges
Some parts of the county are quite cold, or too hot. We'll need to keep people comfortable by ensuring they're warm enough, but also not too warm. If people are too cold or too hot they can become unhappy and may eventually leave.\n\nIn cold locations, place radiators around the hospital. In hot locations we'll need air-conditioning. Use the temperature visualisation mode to identify cold and hot areas of the hospital.\n\nMake all of the hospital a comfortable temperature to maximise our Thermal Comfort rating.

We've done it, the script now holds together. Our analysis revealed that it was important that the butler did it, or they were dreaming, or the good guy was actually a bad guy, or something… To be honest I can't really remember, it didn't seem very good, but let's keep that to ourselves.
Film star, and self proclaimed writer and director, Roderick Cushion has another script that he, and his 'invention team' at Plump it Up Productions Ltd, just can't seem to finish, so now he's turning to science. If we can conduct some analysis and reconcile the script's plot holes then they'll send us some money, and we'll be included in the credits, if this one ever gets made...
Roderick's Plot Hole
We've finished our analysis of the Roachburger menu and sent it off to RB Headquarters. They've hired a few dozen lawyers and three gurus and are apparently working on a settlement with the accusers. It's been a great big scandalous mess and our research has been at its juicy and mysterious centre. This has been great publicity for the institute, which is now a power in County research again.
Word of the Institute's resurgence has reached the County and now we've been rewarded, the Institute just received its biggest inquiry in half a century. The owner of Roachburger has been court ordered to conduct analysis on their entire menu. This case is a County-wide press event and could elevate the Institute to new heights. 
Roachburger Scandal
We've finished our comprehensive evaluation of life in Two Point County. The mayor's office said that the results were exactly what they were afraid of. They won't be pursuing the project any further, or publishing the results, but thanked us for our cooperation and our continued silence on the matter. A bit sinister I suppose, but working with the Two Point's government, on this project that apparently "confirmed everything is already perfect", has cemented Swelbard as the County's definitive centre of research.
Mayor Windsock promised in her campaign that she would lead an evaluation of Two Point County life so thorough that it would conclude whether, and how, society should be restructured for the betterment of civilian life. The Mayor's office have made contact with us about conducting this governmental research, the results of which might define the future of the County (forever). 
Project Windsock
Great news, we've completed our work for Cheesy Gubbins. The cheese profile of each gubbin has been increased by 0.01%. They're thrilled.
The makers of Cheesy Gubbins are looking to outsource some of their cutting-edge culinary science, and have asked if we'd be interested in working with them. They're hoping to make their famous gubbins even cheesier, so want us to analyse the constitution of their recipe to see if the cheese density can be amplified further.
Cheesier Gubbins

Cures patients with Premature Mummification.\nTakes the man out of the monster, but not the other way around.
Cryptology is used to cure patients suffering from Premature Mummification. The bandages are carefully removed in the hope that this will remind the patient that they are actually still alive.\nTo improve cure rates, research and apply upgrades to the machine. Also assign a nurse trained with extra treatment skills.
Cryptology
Cures a range of illnesses.\nHome of the age-old 'Cut Them Open' method.
Surgery is used to treat a range of illnesses. This requires a Doctor trained in Surgery, and a Nurse to assist them.\nTo improve cure rates, assign a doctor trained with higher levels of surgery skill.
Surgery
Cures patients with Pandemic.\nRemoves pans from the head stuck within them.
The Pans Lab is used to cure Pandemic patients.\nOriginally designed by Bungle Technologies, the company has allowed other organisations to purchase the required machinery.\nTo improve cure rates, you'll need upgrades for the machine. Also assign a doctor trained with extra treatment skills.
Pans Lab
Cures a range of illnesses.\nServes everything on the medicinal menu.
Pharmacies are used to cure a range of illnesses.\nTo improve cure rates, you'll need upgrades for the machine. Also assign a nurse trained with extra treatment skills.

Cures and Diagnoses a range of Psychiatric illnesses.\nTreats ailments of the mind.
Psychiatry can be used to diagnose and treat a range of psychiatric conditions.\nTo improve results, assign a doctor trained in higher levels of psychiatry.
Psychiatry
Patients register here after arriving at the hospital.\nEvery journey begins somewhere...
Visitors check in at reception when they first arrive at the hospital. The receptionist sends patients straight to a GP's Office for diagnosis to begin.\nTo process people faster, use assistants trained in customer service.\nAdd more pods to the reception area to allow more receptionists to work there.
Reception
Launch research projects to design new types of equipment, and become better at diagnosing and curing illnesses.\nStart a research project by selecting a research pod and choosing a project.
To start a research project, either click on the research pod, or drop a researcher into the room. In the research screen, you can select a project from the available projects list.\nOnce a project has been started, you'll need a Doctor with a Research Qualification to carry out the work. They will contribute research to the project over time, based on their research skill.\nResearch is shared across the whole organisation, as are the discoveries we make. You can start a project in one hospital and then continue work on it in another hospital.\nTo speed up research progress, use multiple researchers, train them in higher level research qualifications, and add specialist equipment to the room.
Research
Staff relax here when on a break.\nPlace someone here to make them take a break.
Staff will head to a Staff Room when they're on a break, looking to relax and get their energy levels up. A larger room filled with interesting items will help them become fully refreshed before their break time is over. Energised staff are more productive.\nWhen staff are working, they will want to take a break when their energy levels get low. Hospital policy allows a percentage of each staff type to take a break at one time. You can adjust these policies in the staff section of the overview screen.\nNote: You can place a member of staff in a Staff Room to make them take a break, or place them in a work room to make them work there.
Staff Room
People should… you know, here.\nWhere it's always toilet time.
Many of humanity's greatest ideas and endeavours were dreamt up during a visit to the lavatory. In a recent survey, the toilet also topped the list of the county's favourite places to take a dump.\nMake sure to keep your toilets clean, otherwise hygiene levels can drop and spread germs to the rest of the hospital. On that topic, don't forget to install sinks and hand dryers.
Toilets
Teach staff new qualifications.\nStart a training course by dropping a member of staff here or selecting a lectern, picking which qualification you want to teach, then adding trainees.
To start a training course, click on the lectern, or drop a suitable member of staff into the room. Staff will also request training when they're ready.\nIn the training screen, select the qualification you want staff to learn, assign a trainer, and select the staff you wish to send on this course. When you're ready, click the start button.\nWhen picking a trainer, you can use your own staff, choosing one of their qualifications to teach. Or you can pay extra to bring in a guest trainer.\nTo increase training speed, add extra training resources to the room, and use staff with additional training skills.
Training
Cures patients with Turtle Head.\nRestores heads to their original depth.
This powerful machine is used to cure patients suffering with Turtle Head.\nTo improve cure rates, research and apply upgrades to the machine. Also use doctors trained in treatment.
Head Office
Cures and Diagnoses a range of illnesses.\nLike a B&B without the breakfast.
Wards can be used for diagnosis, and also to treat a range of illnesses. A nurse is required to admit each patient, look after them, and discharge them when they're ready to leave.\nAdd multiple beds to a ward to deal with more than one patient at a time.\nYou can also adjust the room settings to request that more nurses work here - this is useful if you have lots of patients.\nTo improve results, use nurses trained in ward management, diagnosis and treatment.
Ward
High-Tech Diagnosis.\nExcellent for spotting items lost inside of people.
A high-tech diagnosis room. Great for diagnosing a range of illnesses, in particular fracture-based illnesses.\nTo improve results, research and apply upgrades to the X-Ray machine. Also use doctors trained in diagnostics or radiology.
